<h2>CHAPTER I—A QUESTION FOR THE FUTURE</h2>
<p>
“Tomorrow evening at this time I’ll be back in
my old room at Hamilton. Tonight, the Country
of College seems very far away. Tomorrow, it will
be Sanford that seems so.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie Dean smiled frankly up into Hal
Macy’s rather sober face. The strains of a slow
waltz were throbbing to an harmonic end. Hal and
his sister Jerry were giving a farewell hop in honor
of the five Lookouts who were to return to Hamilton
College the next day. Hal was thinking, as he
looked down at Marjorie’s lovely, upraised face
that no one, not even her father and mother, would
miss her as he should.
</p>
<p>
“And who are you going to miss most?” he
asked boldly, his eyes twinkling, nevertheless. “If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
you say myself, I shall be <em>so</em> flustered. You never
say nice things to me, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not going to begin now,” Marjorie returned
mischievously. “I shall miss General and Captain
most, <em>of course</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“And <em>me</em> next most. I’ll say it for you, since
you have no regard for my tender feelings. I think
I ought to be ranked next to General and Captain,”
Hal persisted audaciously.
</p>
<p>
“You do come next to them Hal—you and Connie
and Laurie. The old guard are next dearest,”
Marjorie hastily assured. “Oh, dear, the waltz is
ending! I wish it would begin all over again. I
like waltzing much better than fox trotting or one-stepping.
And I love that particular waltz. It is
called ‘In Sunny Gardens,’ and there is a certain
suggestion of the title in the music, I think.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie had sought hasty refuge in commenting
on the waltz music just ended. Hal might appear
to be joking. Marjorie knew he was not. During
the summer vacation she had been in his company
a great deal. The Deans had spent the summer at
Severn Beach, a seaside resort patronized yearly by
the Macys. Jerry and Marjorie had been constantly
together, with Hal a delightfully persistent third
party, whenever the two girls allowed him the
privilege.
</p>
<p>
Hal Macy had been Marjorie’s devoted cavalier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
since the beginning of her high school days. Three
years older than herself, he was already sure of his
love for her. Marjorie, however, regarded him
through the eyes of friendship only. She was still
too greatly absorbed in college to make room in her
life for romance. To her it was a vague something
too remote from her mind to be considered. She
did not wish Hal to be other than her friend of the
old days. The bare thought of changing that pleasant
friendly footing for a fonder relationship was
repugnant to her.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll ask the musicians to play that waltz again, if
you like, Marjorie. Say the word.”
</p>
<p>
Any momentary disappointment Hal might have
felt did not betray itself in his tones. It was not
the first time Marjorie had refused to take him seriously.
He understood her too well to feel more
than a momentary twinge over her indifference
toward sentiment.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, never mind, Hal. I only said that because
I liked the music so much. Thank you, just the
same.”
</p>
<p>
“Have some lemonade, then. I am determined
to please you, if I can.” Hal took gentle hold on
Marjorie’s arm and began steering her toward the
lemonade bowl which stood at one end of the long
room.
</p>
<p>
“You always please me, Hal,” was the instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
response. “You are the best boy ever was, and I
never fail to have a perfectly scrumptious time at
yours and Jerry’s parties. Now <em>you</em> can’t say again
that I never said anything nice to you.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s not bad for a beginning.” Hal put on a
critical expression. “Say something else nice to
me.” His eyes regarded her very steadily now.
</p>
<p>
“Let me see.” Marjorie knitted her brows.
“Well, I wish we had a ball room like this. We
always have to dance in our living room, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a good old room. We have had some fine
times here.” Hal found it harder this time to be
casual, but he succeeded. It was plain to be seen
Marjorie didn’t care a button about him, except as
a friend. He resolved to keep the conversation
strictly impersonal thereafter.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie was hard-hearted enough to feel glad
of the change in Hal’s tone. His almost humbly-expressed
desire to please her had touched her. It
had brought forth from her the sincere little speech
regarding her liking for him. The deepening light
in his eyes, however, had warned her to rush from
the subject to one more comfortably impersonal.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to be lonesome this winter, Marjorie,”
Hal continued. “I am about the only fellow in the
crowd I’ve always run with to be left in Sanford.
Danny’s going to New York to study law. Did I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
tell you the Crane is going to Buffalo to take
charge of a branch of his governor’s business?
Harry Lenox is going on the road for their business.
And Laurie!” Hal made a gesture of resignation.
“He’ll not be far away. Only the Atlantic
Ocean between us! That’s all! I was in hopes he
wouldn’t go back to Europe this winter. Circumstances,
however—” Hal stopped suddenly.
</p>
<p>
The significance of his tone caused Marjorie to
interrogate quickly: “Circumstances? What do you
mean, Hal?”
</p>
<p>
“It is plain you haven’t heard something you are
due to hear. I can’t explain. I can only say this—Don’t
be surprised at anything you may hear.” Hal
made this mysterious assertion with the suspicion
of a tantalizing smile.
</p>
<p>
Before Marjorie could inquire further as to his
meaning, Danny Seabrooke joined them with: “The
next dance will be a fox trot. Bid Macy a pleasant
but sudden farewell, Marjorie, and prepare to dance
it with me. I am a much better dancer than he.
You will have something agreeable to look forward
to.” He simpered at Marjorie, then closed one eye
and squinted reflectively at Hal.
</p>
<p>
“Hope you’ll be in condition to dance that fox
trot.” The silky intonation was not without
menace.
</p>
<p>
“I trust that I shall. It all depends. If I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
persuade Marjorie to leave this danger-laden spot
at once, all will be well.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be too confident. There’s many a
slip——”
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” Danny cut in wisely. “I have fallen
down three times on this floor tonight. I know all
about that slip business.”
</p>
<p>
This confession merely provoked unsympathetic
laughter on the part of his hearers.
</p>
<p>
The lively music of the fox trot beginning, Danny
made an elaborate salaam to Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“Goodbye for the present, Hal. I’m coming back
to quiz you about that mysterious remark you just
made,” she called over her shoulder as she started
to dance away.
</p>
<p>
“You may expect <em>me</em>, too,” assured Danny.
“Farewell!” He beamed foolishly at Hal and
waved his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Farewell. You needn’t mind coming back, Dan-yell,”
Hal flung ironically after him.
</p>
<p>
Readers of the “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean High School Series</span>,”
comprising the four volumes, “<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean, High School Sophomore</span>,”
“<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean, High School Junior</span>,” and
“<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean, High School Senior</span>,” are already in close
touch with Marjorie and her friends.
</p>
<p>
Those who have been pleased to follow her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
through four years of high school life have undoubtedly
been interested in her further doings as a student
at Hamilton College. The account of her
three years of hard study and progress, both social
and mental, has been faithfully set down in “<span class='sc'>Marjorie
Dean, College Freshman</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Marjorie
Dean, College Sophomore</span>,” and “<span class='sc'>Marjorie
Dean, College Junior</span>.”
</p>
<p>
During the spirited fox trot Marjorie wondered
busily as to the meaning of Hal’s remark. Her musings
were forcedly disjointed. Danny now and
again interpolated into his dancing an additional
funny step which kept her attention on him.
</p>
<p>
The dance over, she promptly sought Hal. Now
he was disposed to be thoroughly tantalizing. He
laughed at her and accused her of undue curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“<em>All right!</em> Keep your old secret, Mister
Stingy!” she at last exclaimed in laughing vexation.
“I won’t dance with you again this evening, just to
pay you for being so aggravating.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t my secret,” Hal began by way of conciliation.
“The reason I mentioned it to you was
because I was told you were to share it. Go and
find Connie. She will tell you. I’ve told you too
much already. I’m a <em>fine</em> repository for secrets.”
Hal put sarcastic emphasis on the “fine.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll forgive you when I find out what it is.
There goes Connie now. I’m going to ask her.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
Marjorie hurried off to intercept Constance, who
was crossing the floor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Lieutenant!” Constance exclaimed, her fair
face radiant. “I was just looking for you. I’ve
something to report.”
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead. I’ve something to report, too,” Marjorie
returned gayly. “Let us go downstairs to the
window seat. We can have a wee little talk there.”
</p>
<p>
Arm in arm the two girls steered their course to
the door of the ball room. At the foot of the rather
steep stairway was a double window with a deep
cushioned seat. There they settled themselves for
an exchange of confidences. The full light of the
white, sailing moon flooded the window seat, lending
to the two young faces an enchantment of
beauty.
</p>
<p>
Constance was wearing a pale blue chiffon frock,
embellished here and there with small clusters of
pinkish-white rosebuds. It was a facsimile of a
blue gown long since laid away as a treasure of a
by-gone day. The worn-out gown of blue chiffon
had been Marjorie’s first gracious gift to Constance.
</p>
<p>
“You look just exactly as you did the night of
the Hallowe’en party when you wore the other blue
dress, Connie,” Marjorie said. “Will you ever forget
that night?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I couldn’t. I still count it as the most
eventful night of my life. It was my first dance, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
first party dress, my first meeting with Laurie.”
Constance became suddenly silent. Her hand
reached out and found one of Marjorie’s.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Connie?” Marjorie understood that
Constance had something special on her mind which
she was about to impart.
</p>
<p>
“I—I—Oh, Marjorie! I am not going to wait
to be married to Laurie next June when he comes
back from Europe. I am going to be married to
him on Thanksgiving Day and go to Europe with
him. We’re going to study together there.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Connie Stevens! You take my breath!”
Marjorie, who had been sitting very straight relaxed
with a little, “Ah-h!”
</p>
<p>
“I knew you’d be flabbergasted.” Constance’s
reply was tenderly apologetic. “I just had to tell
you, though. We would be married as early as
October, but, if we were, then you girls couldn’t
come to our wedding on account of college restrictions.
It will be a very quiet wedding. When we
come home next June we will give a reception and
invite all our friends. I am so happy, Marjorie. I
couldn’t bear to be separated from Laurie for
another year.” Constance hid her glowing face
against Marjorie’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie listened to Constance, not yet over her
first amazement at the news. Hal’s words, “Don’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
be surprised at anything you may hear,” returned
with force.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a beautiful plan, Connie,” she approved,
when she found her voice again. Both arms went
out to encircle her friend.
</p>
<p>
“I knew you would agree with us.” Constance
gave a little sigh of satisfaction. “Aunt Susan was
not pleased, at first. She wished to announce our
betrothal formally at a reception for me this winter.
She has been so dear to us. She was broad-minded
enough to allow for such stray musicians as Laurie
and me. Neither of us care about pomp and ceremony,
you know.”
</p>
<p>
Constance raised her head. In her blue dress,
with the moonlight playing upon her soft, childish
features and golden hair, Marjorie thought she
looked even younger than she had appeared at the
eventful Hallowe’en party. Then, poverty and unhappiness
had marred her beauty. Now, it had
grown with every good gift that had been showered
upon her.
</p>
<p>
“Marjorie,” she continued very solemnly: “I have
never said a word to you before, but—” with a
slight pause, “I hope you will marry Hal some day.
I am sure he loves you as dearly as Laurie loves
me.” Constance spoke with the sincerity of the
truly happy. She had found love. “You have always
been friendly with Hal, but I understand you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
don’t love him now. I have watched you both, and
I know he cares a great deal more for you than you
for him. I don’t mean I wish you would fall in love
with Hal tomorrow or next week or even next year,
but, someday, I hope you will.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t wish to fall in love with Hal or anybody
else.” Marjorie shook her head with a decision that
loosened a curl from the thick, wavy masses of hair
drawn over her ears. She frowned down the remote
possibility of such a catastrophe. “It has
always been different with you and Laurie than with
Hal and me. You two were really lovers as far
back as your sophomore year at Sanford High.
Hal and I have been just good friends, and so far as
I am concerned, we are going to stay <em>just good
friends</em>.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>CHAPTER II—THE RETURN OF THE “TRAVELERS”</h2>
<p>
“And is it yourselves, and no other? Where
was I, may I ask, that I was not at the station to
meet you?”
</p>
<p>
Leila Harper stood at the top of the front steps
of Wayland Hall just long enough to thus interrogate
the party of four girls who were advancing
toward her. With a jubilant Irish whoop she made
a sudden, forceful descent of the steps and landed
among them with open arms.
</p>
<p>
“And I am that glad to see you!” she exclaimed.
“Here I have been, melancholy as a roofless banshee,
for two whole days. Vera, may the moon defend
her and the sun lend her grace, was to be here today.
Still no sign of our respected and regretted
Midget!”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe we aren’t glad to see you, Leila Greatheart!”
Marjorie was embracing Leila with a fervor
that bespoke her affection for the genial Irish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
girl. “I would have wired you we were coming,
but I hadn’t heard from you for three weeks, neglectful
person, so I didn’t know where you were.”
</p>
<p>
“Now has it really been three weeks?” Leila inquired
ingeniously, then laughed. “I’m guilty,
Beauty. Forgive your Celtic friend. I am always
meaning to write letters. It’s not lack of intention,
but lack of execution that troubles me. But where
is Ronny?” Making the round of greeting as she
talked, Leila had now missed Veronica Lynne.
</p>
<p>
“Ronny hasn’t come from the West yet.” Muriel
replied to the question. “This is the first year she
hasn’t traveled to Hamilton with us. My, how I
have missed her! We used to have such lovely
squabbles on the train, all the way to college. It
made things so pleasant and lively.” Muriel’s
brown eyes danced as she forwarded this naive admission.
</p>
<p>
“Ronny and her father went on one of their long
pony-riding trips,” Marjorie further enlightened
Leila. “She may be on the way East now. I have
not heard from her for over a month. Miss Archer,
her God-mother, has only received one letter from
her since the first of July. When she is on one of
those trips she doesn’t write letters for she has no
chance to mail them.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s back, Leila?” eagerly inquired Jerry, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
the party leisurely ascended the steps, Leila in the
middle of the group.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly anyone, yet. It is early, you know.
Mary Cornell and Eva Ingram are here; Kathie,
too.”
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” Lucy Warner’s face lighted at this
news. “How long since Kathie came, Leila?”
</p>
<p>
“Day before yesterday. She is staying at Lillian’s.
I saw her when she got off the train. So
did Lillian. Result—I haven’t seen her since.”
</p>
<p>
“I must call her on the telephone this very afternoon,”
planned Lucy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what I shall do without Hortense,”
wailed Muriel. “I’ll be simply lost without her. I
am glad I arranged for a single. I don't want a
room-mate, so long as I can’t have good old Moretense.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; and recall what a fuss you made when
Miss Remson asked you to let good old Moretense
have half of your room,” reminded Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“I was a grass-green, arrogant freshman, then,”
Muriel loftily excused. “I had not yet attained to
heights of wisdom and discernment which—er—ahem—became
mine later.”
</p>
<p>
“When did this miracle you speak of take place?”
Jerry affected deep interest. “First I’d heard of it.
I never even suspected it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“I never answer foolish questions,” retaliated
Muriel. “There are persons who make a practice of
asking them. Such persons should not be encouraged.”
</p>
<p>
“Pay no attention to those two, Leila,” Marjorie
advised. “Talk to Lucy and me. Tell me, are there
any new arrivals at the Hall?”
</p>
<p>
“Two freshies. I haven’t asked Miss Remson
their names. They have Leslie Cairns’ room. They
are a noisy pair. I hear them giggling and talking
in the halls at every turn.”
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t sound as though you admired
them, Leila.” Jerry had not lost what Leila had
been saying.
</p>
<p>
“I do not. As a crusty old post graduate, I am
hard to please.” Leila’s genial smile belied her
words. “I have been too long used to distinguished
company.”
</p>
<p>
“That means us. Bow to the lady.” Muriel gave
Jerry a significant nudge.
</p>
<p>
“Do your own bowing and don’t interrupt. I
want to hear who’s come back and who hasn’t. Go
ahead and tell us some more, Leila. Never mind
my friend here. She is what I should term ‘voluable.’”
Jerry turned her back on Muriel.
</p>
<p>
“Let me see. Martha Merrick is coming back.
With her, Vera, Helen and I, there will be four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
P. G’s. Five Lookouts, make nine of the old girls
here. Eva and Mary make eleven, and there are
six or seven more. In all, perhaps eighteen students
who were here last year. The Hall holds forty-four
girls, but Muriel has a single and Kathie’s room will
stay empty unless some one wins the scholarship she
won. That is not likely to happen.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope Kathie will have half as nice a room at
Randolph House as she had here,” Lucy said. “I’m
going to miss her dreadfully.”
</p>
<p>
Engaged to teach English at the college, Kathie
had applied for admission to Randolph House the
previous June. It was a campus house given over
to members of the faculty.
</p>
<p>
“You will have to be on your best behavior when
you go to see Kathie,” warned Jerry. “The eyes
of the faculty will be upon you.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry about me.” Lucy fixed Jerry with
a withering glance. “<em>I</em> know how to behave. I’m
going into the house to see Miss Remson.” She
reached for her suitcase and leather bag with an air
of lofty disdain.
</p>
<p>
Girl-fashion, the group had reached the floor of
the veranda only to gather about Leila and ask
questions. Following Lucy’s example, they now repossessed
themselves of their luggage and entered
the house to pay their respects to Miss Remson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
She had already heard the babel of voices rising
from the veranda. Recognizing Muriel’s peculiarly
clear, high-pitched tones, she had delightedly hurried
to the door. She met the arrivals on the threshold
and gave them a hearty welcome.
</p>
<p>
“Go up to your rooms, girls, and leave your luggage,”
she directed, after a cordial hand-shaking all
around, “then come down to the dining room. It
is only four o’clock. You need something to eat.
I will have tea ready for you. If I remember
rightly, you Sanford girls have always arrived on a
later train.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; the five-fifty,” Jerry informed. “The train
schedule has been changed. Our train left Sanford
at twenty minutes past seven this morning. It was
the only one we could take that would bring us here
before dark.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a dear, Miss Remson,” lauded Muriel.
“The very thought of tea is inspiring. I’ve been
hungry for the last hour.”
</p>
<p>
“So have I,” echoed Jerry. “No reason for it,
either. We had luncheon on the train.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but at what time?” reminded Muriel. “Precisely
twelve. Four hours’ ride after that on a
bumpety-bumpety train is sufficient cause for a
quick return of appetite.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite true, my dear Miss Harding,” allowed
Jerry, favoring Muriel with a patronizing smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“So glad you agree with me. It might worry me
if you didn’t.” Muriel returned the smile with one
equally patronizing.
</p>
<p>
“Such smirking and beaming, and so deceitful, at
that,” teased Leila.
</p>
<p>
“I’m merely trying to take Ronny’s place with
Muriel,” defended Jerry. “She keeps complaining
that she has no one to squabble with.”
</p>
<p>
“When do you think Veronica will be here?”
Miss Remson had been listening in amusement to
Jerry and Muriel. She was genuinely happy to
have the Lookouts back at Wayland Hall again.
“I received one long, delightful letter from her in
July.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know,” answered Marjorie. She went
on to tell the manager what she had already told
Leila regarding Ronny.
</p>
<p>
Such information as she had concerning her missing
chum given, the quartette, accompanied by
Leila, went on up the staircase and once more made
port in their familiar quarters.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, wow!” ejaculated Jerry, as she dropped her
luggage to the floor and sank thankfully upon her
own particular chair. “I’m glad I’m here. I hate
leaving home, but, now that I’ve once more struck
this fond, familiar spot, I find it pretty fair, Bean;
pretty fair.”
</p>
<p>
“I echo your sentiments, Macy. I do, indeed;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
all except the Bean,” Marjorie retorted, giggling,
nevertheless, at the appellation.
</p>
<p>
It was the derisive name which Leslie Cairns, the
leader of the mischief-making Sans, had been
pleased to apply to her. It never failed to make
Marjorie laugh. There was something so utterly
ridiculous about it. Jerry occasionally found
amusement also in addressing her as “Bean.”
</p>
<p>
“You are always so good to us, Miss Remson,”
Marjorie gratefully voiced, when presently the hungry
travelers had gathered at a table in the long,
cool dining room. The day being warm, the manager
had thoughtfully provided a tall pitcher of iced
tea and a large plate of chicken, olive and lettuce
sandwiches.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t think me stingy for not offering you more
of a spread. I wish you to have some appetite for
dinner. This little bite will be just a help along the
way until dinner time.”
</p>
<p>
“No wonder everybody is crazy to live at Wayland
Hall,” commented Muriel, in appreciation of
the manager’s kindly efforts.
</p>
<p>
“I am so sorry Anna Towne and the girls off the
campus wouldn’t allow us to carry out our plan for
them.” Marjorie looked her regret. “We wanted
them here, you know.”
</p>
<p>
The “plan” to which she now referred had been
one mapped out by herself and Robina Page during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
her junior year at Hamilton. They had agreed to
save a part of their spending money through the
college year and also the summer vacation. Object
of their self-denial, to make it possible for Anna
Towne, and one other off-the-campus girl whom
Robin should select, to enjoy the comfort of Wayland
Hall as a residence. Their particular friends
had been quick to imitate the example they had set.
Altogether fourteen girls had joined in the generous
movement.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie and Robin had been detailed to put the
offer before the girls each youthful benefactor had
elected to help. Two weeks before the close of college
Robin had invited them to a spread in her room
and there explained matters. No amount of urging,
however, on hers and Marjorie’s part, could persuade
them to take advantage of the offer. It was
with reluctance that they even consented to go on
accepting assistance from the students’ beneficiary
recently formed.
</p>
<p>
None of the young philanthropists had been sanguine
of an acceptance of their generosity. At least
it had been made in good faith. According to Jerry
it was too bad they “couldn’t see it,” but it hadn’t
done any special harm to cut out a few extravagances.
The money each had saved to such a worthy
end was collected by Robin and added to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
sum on deposit as the Hamilton College Beneficiary
Fund in a Hamilton Bank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, no one could blame the girls for feeling
as they did about letting us help them. In their
position, I suppose it would have been the same
with us,” was Muriel Harding’s opinion. “It would
have been fine to have them at the Hall. They are
a dandy lot of girls.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry, too, that they will not be here,” Miss
Remson said. She had been signally interested in
the idea at the time it had been agitated. “I expect
sixteen freshmen here and eight upper class students.
Two of these last are from Craig Hall, two from
Acasia House, and four from Alston Terrace. I
had a number of applications from students at other
campus houses but took the first eight who applied.”
</p>
<p>
“Alston Terrace?” Leila interrogated, lively interest
animating her expressive features. “Would
you mind telling us, Miss Remson, who is coming
from Alston Terrace?”
</p>
<p>
Every pair of eyes now fastened upon the manager,
looked inquiry. The same thought had flashed
through each brain.
</p>
<p>
“I have not familiarized myself with the new
names as yet. I will go for my register. It will be
a good plan to go over these names with you girls.
The students from other campus houses are no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
doubt acquaintances, perhaps friends, of yours. As
seniors, you will wish to know the names of the
freshmen who are to be here. I depend on you to
help them to feel at home.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Remson rose from her chair and left the
room. A brief silence followed her exit, during
which five girls regarded one another speculatively.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>CHAPTER III—THE INTRUDER</h2>
<p>
“I wonder——” Jerry stopped, a displeased
pucker between her brows.
</p>
<p>
“You are not the only one.” Leila shrugged her
shoulders. “I do not like the sound of ‘four from
Alston Terrace.’ There might be one of the four
not quite to our taste.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean Miss Walbert, don’t you?” Jerry
questioned frankly.
</p>
<p>
“I do. She has been aching to get into Wayland
Hall. Vera and I were told that last year. And
what is to prevent her? I doubt if Miss Remson
knows of her friendship with the departed but not
regretted Sans,” Leila argued.
</p>
<p>
“She must have noticed her last year when she
same to see Miss Cairns. I met her in the halls
more than once,” Muriel said quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Remson would pay no special attention to
visitors from other campus houses. The maid
would admit them to the Hall,” returned Leila.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
“Don’t you know, Miss Remson is famous here at
Hamilton for minding her own affairs? She never
interferes with the girls in such matters so long as
they keep within bounds.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use in borrowing trouble,” interposed
Marjorie cheerfully. “Miss Walbert may not
be one of the four students from Alston Terrace to
register here. Even if she should be, why need we
care one way or the other? When Miss Remson
first mentioned it, I thought of her too. We all did,
I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“And why?” Leila turned quickly to Marjorie.
“Because we all know her for what she is, a snob
and a deceitful little peacock. In my old age and
dignity I longed for peace—but not with that
trouble-maker in the house. You remember—Jerry
and I both took a rooted dislike to her the first time
we set eyes on her at the station. I never found
reason to change my opinion other.” Leila spoke
with decided warmth.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” echoed Jerry. “I’m going to tell Miss
Remson, if she reads off Miss Walbert’s name, precisely
what she may expect from her. Phyllis
Moore said she made so much trouble for the
freshies as president of their class that if it hadn’t
been so near the end of the year they would have
appointed a committee to tell her where she got
off at.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
Before more could be said on the subject of the
disagreeable Miss Walbert the manager was among
them again, register in hand. The five girls
watched her in canny silence as she opened the
familiar black book and let her index finger travel
down the page of registrations.
</p>
<p>
“You asked about the students from Alston Terrace,
Leila. They are Miss Schultz, Miss Kane,
Miss Mead and Miss Walbert. Are any of these
friends of yours?” Miss Remson glanced up from
the page.
</p>
<p>
“No. Three of them I do not know. One I do
not wish to know.” Leila’s bright blue eyes met
the manager’s squarely.
</p>
<p>
“Which is the one you do not wish to know,
Leila? I ask you the question because I know your
fairness of mind. If you do not care to know this
student you must have good reason for your attitude
toward her. Will you be frank with me?”
</p>
<p>
“None of us like Miss Walbert,” Leila said
slowly, after a brief pause during which she mentally
framed what she wished to say. “We don’t
wish to keep her out of the Hall. We only wish
you to know that she is a trouble-maker. She was
a friend of Leslie Cairns. It is seldom you hear me
speak against anyone, Miss Remson,” Leila continued.
“Knowing what you had to endure from
the Sans, I feel free to warn you against this girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
She may never justify my warning. Still you have
the truth about her.”
</p>
<p>
Leila had not spoken from characteristic Irish
impulse alone. A sense of practical friendly duty
toward Miss Remson had also prompted her bold
stand. The manager quite understood this.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Leila,” she said gravely. “You understand
my position here. I am not a boarding-house
keeper who must have references. I am supposed
to take these students changing from another
campus house to Wayland Hall on faith. Now I
recall why Miss Walbert’s face seemed so familiar.
I must have noticed her last year during her calls
here on Miss Cairns, then paid no further attention
to her. It is most unfortunate. Had I known of
her friendship with Miss Cairns, I should have refused
her application. She would have considered
me prejudiced, but I should not have cared. She
applied for a single. I had none to give her. She
is to room with Miss Schultz.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry for Miss Schultz,” commented irrepressible
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t be,” laughed Marjorie. “She is
independent enough to look out for herself. She
is often in the Chemical Laboratory when I am.
She is a dig of the first water and a very brilliant
student. She won’t bother her head about Miss
Walbert.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“It is to be hoped her influence may prove beneficial,”
remarked the manager dryly. “I am very
certain that I want no repetitions of the noisy quarrel
which took place in Miss Cairns’ room one evening
last winter. Luckily Miss Walbert will have
no one to aid and abet her in making mischief, as
would be the case if Miss Cairns and that group of
girls were still here. I will read you the other
names.”
</p>
<p>
Her listeners were not sorry to close the subject.
With relief they riveted their attention on the list
of names read out to them. When it came to the
two students from Acasia House they received another
shock. Miss Remson named Alida Burton
and Lola Elster.
</p>
<p>
The manager’s eyes on her book, she did not see
the significant glances which flashed back and forth
at this news. None of her hearers made open comment
on either name. While they did not approve
of either Lola Elster or Alida Burton they had seen
little of them since their freshman year.
</p>
<p>
Later, on the way to their rooms, Marjorie expressed
herself as wondering whether, after all, they
should have mentioned to Miss Remson the former
intimacy of both girls with the Sans.
</p>
<p>
“I hated to say anything more.” Leila thus explained
her silence on that point. “Those two are
very chummy. They troubled no one last year. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
heard Leslie Cairns was very sore at their desertion
of her standard.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll mention the fact to Miss Remson some day
when it comes just right. I think she ought to
know it,” was Jerry’s view.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until Vera comes. She will break the
news to Miss Remson in that nice soft little way of
hers which never holds a bit of malice. I am hoping
she will appear tomorrow. Not since I left her
in New York in June have I set eyes on her. Her
father spirited her away to visit an aunt in Idaho.
It’s our Midget who will come back a wild and
woolly Westerner. Can you not see her in a cowboy
hat with a brace of revolvers at her belt?”
Leila humorously painted.
</p>
<p>
The idea of dainty, diminutive Vera in any such
garb was provocative of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t it make you sick to think that Walbert
snip is coming to the Hall to live?” Jerry vented
her supreme disgust the moment she and Marjorie
were behind their door.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t stopped to think much about it,” Marjorie
confessed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, think about it now, then. I never adored
the Sans, but I can’t stand <em>her</em>. She will stir up a
fuss here if she has half a chance. She is as much
of a fusser as Rowena Quarrelena Fightena Scrapena
used to be. I’m positively, heartily and completely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
disgusted over such bad news.” Jerry’s tone
was half joking, half serious. “I was looking for
pleasant sailing and no snags.”
</p>
<p>
“Our best plan is to pay no attention to her,”
Marjorie placidly returned. “It is her fault that
none of us are on speaking terms with her. She
began cutting us the same day we tried to help her
at the station.”
</p>
<p>
“And that lets us out,” decreed Jerry slangily.
“As seniors we can look down on her with a cold
and unpitying eye. Something like this.” Jerry
drew herself up and stared at Marjorie with icy
fixity.
</p>
<p>
“Br-r-r! Don’t try that on me again unless I
have my fur coat handy,” was Marjorie’s joking
reception of that freezing stare. “Excuse me for
changing the subject, but let us go over to Silverton
Hall after dinner this evening. I’d like to see
who’s back.”
</p>
<p>
“De-lighted. We won’t eat much dinner after
those sandwiches. We could cut out dinner tonight
and start for Silverton Hall early. We’d then be
hungry enough on the way home to stop at Baretti’s.
Miss Remson won’t feel hurt if we aren’t here for
dinner. We had tea with her. Besides, she knows
how it is when one first comes back to college.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she won’t mind,” Marjorie assured confidently.
“We’d better tell the others right away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
You go and see Lucy. I’ll tell Leila and Muriel.”
</p>
<p>
“As soon as I put away this stuff from my suitcase,”
Jerry promised. Her suitcase on the floor
beside her couch, she had strewed the contents from
one end of the bed to the other. “I suppose,” she
began afresh, as she gathered up her toilet set and
moved with it toward her chiffonier, “that I ought
to——”
</p>
<p>
The speech remained unfinished. Suddenly and
without warning the door opened. A young woman
in an automobile dust coat and cap walked serenely
in. At sight of the two startled occupants of the
room she set her leather traveling bag down with a
sharp, “Well; may I ask what you two girls are
doing in my room?” The newcomer was Elizabeth
Walbert.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>CHAPTER IV—A BIT OF NEWS</h2>
<p>
“Your room? Since when?” Jerry had forgotten
all about the icy stare with which she intended
to freeze this very person. She was gazing at the
intruder with belligerence, not hauteur. Her tone
conveyed an ominous chill to the too-sure claimant.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand you,” she returned with a
slight toss of her head. “I only know that I was
assigned to this room by Miss Remson.”
</p>
<p>
“Did she come to the door of this room with
you?” inquired Jerry bluntly.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not. She assigned me to Room 16.
You two have evidently made a mistake. I know I
haven’t.” Another toss of the head, more disagreeably
pronounced. “I didn’t need her or a maid to
show me. I know this house.”
</p>
<p>
“The number of this room is 15. Miss Macy and
I have had it for three years,” Marjorie broke in
evenly. “You will find 16 across the hall. The
numbers on this side of the hall are odd; on the
other, even.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” The arrogant claimant turned poppy-red.
Plainly in the wrong, Marjorie’s civil, utterly dispassionate
information fell upon her ears as a merited
rebuke. “I was told—” she began feebly. “I
am sure the number over this door <em>looks</em> like 16.
This is the room I <em>wanted</em>. I beg your pardon.
Still I don’t understand——”
</p>
<p>
In spite of the grudging apology she appeared
only half convinced. Marjorie merely inclined her
head without speaking. Jerry was silent from sheer
disgust. The battery of two pairs of eyes full upon
her proved too much for the intruder. She made a
rather hurried exit, closing the door behind her with
enough force to indicate a rise of temper.
</p>
<p>
“Blunderhead!” pronounced Jerry contemptuously.
“I understand now why she can’t be taught
to drive her car with safety to the public. She is
really stupid underneath her trickiness.”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad she didn’t look before she leaped.” A
quiet little smile dimpled the corners of Marjorie’s
red lips. She had been merely amused at the incident.
</p>
<p>
“She must have felt foolish,” Jerry declared.
“That’s what we might call ‘Skirmish, Number
One.’ I daresay we’ll have more of them with her
Walbertship before we receive our diplomas and
hike for Sanford.”
</p>
<p>
“Not if I can help it,” vowed Marjorie, still smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
This time it was at Jerry’s funny way of
phrasing her opinions.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot. I was going to tell Lucy about
going to Silverton Hall. I’ll put the rest of these
things away when I come back. As long as I am to
tell her, I might as well see Leila and Muriel. You
go ahead and finish unpacking your suitcase.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry left the room on her errand. She presently
returned with all three girls. The start for
Silverton Hall was promptly made, the five friends
strolling bareheaded across the campus.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie thought she had never seen her “second
friend,” as she liked to term the campus, looking
more verdantly beautiful. A fairly rainy summer
had left the short, thick grass peculiarly vivid
in its greenness. The leaves of every decorative
shrub and tree seemed greener than of yore. It was
as though the life of the free emerald spread was
rising, not waning, with the approach of autumn.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Silverton Hall, disappointment
awaited them. Not one of their particular friends
had returned. Half a dozen seniors grouped in
girlishly picturesque attitudes on the veranda welcomed
the callers with warmth. Leila, in particular,
was hailed with delight. Her great popularity with
the Silvertonites made her return as a post graduate
a matter of rejoicing.
</p>
<p>
Place was made for the visitors on the veranda
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
and the steady hum of voices soon proclaimed an
enthusiastic exchange of campus news. It was
earlier than the Wayland Hall girls had thought.
They therefore declined a pressing invitation to
stay to dinner at Silverton Hall, and, after half an
hour’s stay, got under way again.
</p>
<p>
“Where to?” asked Jerry, as they left the premises
of Silverton Hall. “Fortune isn’t with us tonight.
We are wandering about almost as aimlessly
as on the evening we landed here as freshies. Leila,
excepted, of course. She was a soph then.”
</p>
<p>
“And very well I remember that evening,” rejoined
Leila. “When I saw you Sanfordites come
into Baretti’s I looked at Marjorie and planned the
Beauty contest.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; and inveigled me into joining the line that
night when I had intended to keep out of it,” reproached
Marjorie. “I was really cross with you
for about two minutes, Leila Greatheart.”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis a long day away since then,” Leila lightly
assured.
</p>
<p>
“I asked where we were going, but no one saw
fit to answer me,” complained Jerry. “I’m not
hungry enough yet for Baretti’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s stop and find out,” proposed Muriel.
“Only lunatics keep on going without knowing for
what point they’re bound.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“We might go over to Acasia House and see if
Barbara Severn has come back,” proposed Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“I’d propose going over to Wenderblatts’ to see
Kathie and Lillian, but I haven’t called Kathie on
the ’phone yet. One doesn’t like to descend on a
private family unannounced,” Lucy the proper said
regretfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, make it Acasia House,” Jerry voiced, with a
touch of impatience. “If Barbara hasn’t come back
we may see someone else we know. Either we are
especially early at Hamilton this year, or else everybody
else is late. No one’s home! Boo, hoo!”
Jerry burst into a dismal wail.
</p>
<p>
“I refuse to go another step until you stop that
awful noise,” balked Muriel. “We all feel <em>very</em> sad,
Jeremiah, over the absence of our various friends,
but we try to control our sorrow. Try and do likewise.”
</p>
<p>
“It is ice cream we will be after buying you at the
nice Italian man’s, if you will stop roaring,” wheedled
Leila, adopting a decided brogue.
</p>
<p>
“I believe the rules of Hamilton forbid unseemly
noise on the campus.” Lucy fixed a severe eye on
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
Jesting in this fashion the quintette had again
taken up their walk, this time headed for Acasia
House.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“We started out too early to make our calls,”
commented Marjorie. “The Acasia House girls
will probably be at dinner. It is only half-past six
now.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll only stop a few minutes there. By the
time we have walked that far we may be hungry
enough for a bang-up dinner at Baretti’s,” Jerry
expressed this hope. “Nothing like hiking around
the campus by way of celebrating our return to the
knowledge shop.”
</p>
<p>
Acasia House, however, did not yield the winsome
presence of Barbara Severn. “Not back yet,”
was their second disappointment that evening. As
Marjorie had surmised, such of the students who
had returned were at dinner. The callers mounted
the front steps to a deserted veranda. More, it was
a maid, who, in answer to Marjorie’s ringing of the
doorbell, furnished the information regarding the
still absent Barbara.
</p>
<p>
“Balked all around!” Jerry dramatically struck
her hand to her forehead as the party descended the
steps. They had decided not to try getting acquainted
with the freshmen of Acasia House that
evening. They preferred waiting for Barbara’s return.
</p>
<p>
“Grant Giuseppe hasn’t shut up shop and gone on
a vacation,” grumbled Leila. “’Tis my Irish bones
that ache from so much weary wandering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;up&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hill&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;had&nbsp;&nbsp;gone&nbsp;&nbsp;me&nbsp;&nbsp;fast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;feet&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp;&nbsp;stoned&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;sore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;dale&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;hurried&nbsp;&nbsp;last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;&nbsp;find&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;bolted&nbsp;&nbsp;door.”<br />
</p>
<p>
She had broken into one of the curious wailing
Celtic chants which were the girls’ delight.
</p>
<p>
“Do sing the rest of it, Leila,” begged Muriel, as
the Irish girl stopped laughingly after the fourth
line.
</p>
<p>
“Not now, I should only wail you to tears,” she
declared.
</p>
<p>
“Truly, Leila, I don’t know a Hamilton girl I
would have missed so much as you,” Marjorie said
convincingly, passing her arm across Leila’s shoulders.
“I am <em>so</em> glad you came back!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m thinking I had fine sense,” solemnly agreed
Leila. “And I shall be treating you all at Giuseppe’s
this evening to celebrate my own smartness.”
</p>
<p>
Thus adroitly she had taken the dinner upon herself.
It was usually a matter for animated discussion
as to which one of them should stand treat. A chorus
of dissent arose as it was, but her further wily
and broad Irish reminder, “Will yez be quiet?
Think af me dignity as a P. G!” won her the privilege.
</p>
<p>
Signor Baretti’s welcome of his favorite patrons
was given with true Latin sincerity. He had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
forgotten the serenading party of the previous year
and asked anxiously for Phyllis and her orchestra.
</p>
<p>
“They come back this year, those who play and
sing for me so nice?” he queried. “Many are the
graduates each June. Then I don’t see more. Always
I know those—what you call the fraish—fraish—mens.
Only these are not the mens at all,
but the girls. Why you call these—mens?”
</p>
<p>
The Italian’s evident puzzlement over this point
evoked amused laughter in which he good-naturedly
joined. He showed childish gratification, however,
at Marjorie’s simple explanation of the term.
</p>
<p>
“Never before have I understand,” he confessed.
“Now I must ask something more. You know those
girls I have not like who come here? Every one
know, I don’t like.” He made a sweeping gesture.
“They don’t come here for, oh, long time before college
close. Somebody say they are made to go
away because they don’t do well. You tell me.
That is the truth?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment no one spoke. The blunt innocence
of the inquiry was not to be doubted, however.
The odd little proprietor’s question must be
answered.
</p>
<p>
“They were expelled from college, Signor Baretti,”
Marjorie made grave reply. “You heard the
truth.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
“That mean, they can’t come back more?” persisted
the Italian.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.” Again it was Marjorie who answered
him.
</p>
<p>
“Ah-h-h!” The ejaculation contained a note of
triumph. “So I think. But one, the one these
girls I <em>most</em> don’t like she walk in this place one
day las’ week. This day she is friendly; never
before. She say she come back early. I know better.”
He placed his finger to his eye, a significant
Latin gesture, meaning that he was not to be deceived.
“She think I don’t know. This one is Miss
Car-rins.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>CHAPTER V—JUST FRESHIES</h2>
<p>
The Italian’s announcement was received by his
hearers with varying degrees of surprise. His sole
object in inquiring as he had regarding the Sans
appeared to be a desire to prove his own surmises
as correct. Satisfied on this point, he hospitably
insisted on taking their dinner order himself, and
trotted kitchenward to look after it.
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” Jerry gave vent to her favorite ejaculation
the instant the proprietor of the restaurant
had left them. “Now what do you suppose she is
doing in this part of the world?”
</p>
<p>
“Ask me something easier.” Leila’s dark brows
lifted themselves. “She may be visiting someone
in the town of Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think she would hate to come back
here after what happened,” commented Muriel.
“The idea of her telling Signor Baretti she had
come back early to college. I suppose she thought
he wouldn’t know that she had been expelled.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Be sure your sin will find you out,’” quoted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
Lucy with a touch of satiric humor. “It’s a moral
warning to behave, isn’t it? News of disgrace travels
fast and wide.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Luciferous, it does. I trust that you will
ever walk in the path of rectitude. Let this deplorable
instance be a lesson to you.”
</p>
<p>
Muriel had promptly taken advantage of Lucy’s
remarks. Her mischievous features set in austerity
she managed to keep them thus for at least two seconds.
Then she burst into a ripple of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t lose any sleep over me,” was Lucy’s independent
retort. “Just apply some of that wonderful
advice to yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, if I ever get to where I feel I need it,”
beamingly assured Muriel.
</p>
<p>
Thus the subject of Leslie Cairns’ re-appearance
at Baretti’s was passed over without further comment.
Nor was it renewed again that evening.
Before they left Baretti’s they were treated to a real
surprise. Engaged in eating the delectable dinner
they had ordered, none of the five saw two laughing
faces peering in at them from the main entrance of
the inn. Two pairs of slippered feet stole noiselessly
along the broad aisle between the tables.
</p>
<p>
Looking up from her Waldorf salad, Jerry gave
a sudden cry that was in the nature of a subdued
war whoop of pure joy.
</p>
<p>
“Can you beat it!” she shrieked jubilantly, standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
up and waving her salad fork. “The wanderers
have returned!”
</p>
<p>
Her shout of welcome was quickly taken up by
the others. Leila sprang from her chair and made
one dive toward a diminutive young woman in a
pongee traveling coat and white sports hat. The
Lookouts were equally eager to claim their own.
She happened to be Veronica Lynne.
</p>
<p>
For an instant the hitherto quiet room was filled
with the rising treble of girl voices. They had been
entirely alone in the restaurant since their entrance
save for Signor Baretti and the waitresses.
</p>
<p>
“Our Midget—and see the cunningness of her in
her long coat! Does she not look many inches
taller?” teased Leila, holding Vera at arms’ length
and then re-embracing her.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not even half an inch taller, you old Irish
flatterer,” Vera declared as Leila released her to
greet Ronny. “Oh, girls, it is fine to see you all
again.” Vera clasped her little hands in her own
inimitable fashion.
</p>
<p>
“It’s wonderful to have both of you popping in
on us at once.” Marjorie was holding Ronny’s
hands in her own. “How did you both happen to
arrive here together? It must have been sheer
luck.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you think? We bumped into each
other in Chicago,” Vera informed them. “It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
at the Union Station. I had been feeling awfully
bored by my own society. Father had gone to call
on an old friend between trains. I didn’t care to
go with him. I sat in the women’s inner waiting
room trying to read a magazine when who should
walk straight past me but Ronny. I couldn’t believe
my eyes for a second. Then I made just about such
a dive for her as Leila just made for me.”
</p>
<p>
“I came as far as Chicago in Father’s aeroplane,”
announced Ronny proudly. “It is the longest trip
he ever made. He didn’t wish to go farther east
than Chicago, so he secured a stateroom for me on
the Great Eastern Express. Talk about luck in meeting
Vera! I should say it was luck. We sat up
nearly all night to talk. We both began to feel
sleepy away this side of Hamilton. It will be
an early bedtime for us both tonight, won’t it,
Midget?”
</p>
<p>
“Um-ah!” Vera put a small hand to her mouth
to conceal a rising yawn. “We stopped at the Hall,
but you were gone. We knew where to find you.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you hungry?” demanded Muriel. “We’ve
gone as far as the salad. What’ll you have?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing but some ice cream and a demitasse
for me,” declared Ronny. “We had dinner on the
train.”
</p>
<p>
Vera decided on coffee and a pineapple ice. The
two were soon established at table with their chums,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
listening to the meager amount of college news
which they had to give out.
</p>
<p>
“It must be unusually quiet at Hamilton,” Vera
presently remarked. “Nearly a third of the students
were back at this time last year.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a deserted spot, Midget,” Leila assured.
“We’ve been to Silverton Hall and Acasia House
this evening and none of our special pals from
either house are back yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, I’m back, and so is Ronny. We certainly
count as a couple of someones,” Vera laughed.
“Old Hamilton will blossom out over night. No
one here, then, all of a sudden, everybody back and
things humming.”
</p>
<p>
The first rush of greeting having subsided,
Ronny’s companions bombarded her with eager
questions concerning her trip to Chicago by aeroplane.
Absorbed in what she was relating, none of
them had paid much attention to the few girls who
had dropped into the restaurant.
</p>
<p>
Sounds of singing followed by a burst of rather
loud laughter and high-pitched conversation drew
their gaze simultaneously toward the door. A
crowd of perhaps a dozen girls now entered the
large room, still talking and laughing boisterously.
</p>
<p>
The central figure among them was a girl well
above the medium height and rather heavily built.
Hatless, her short brown hair curled about her face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
in a manner suggesting its natural non-curliness.
Her face was full and her color high. Her bright
brown eyes, though large, contained a boldness of
expression that rather marred their fine shape and
size. Her nose was retroussé and her mouth too
wide for beauty. The ensemble of features was
dashing; not beautiful. She wore a one-piece frock
of pale pink wash satin, a marvel as to cut and
design. Her whole appearance indicated the presence
of wealth. She looked not unlike a spoiled,
overgrown baby.
</p>
<p>
“Freshies, and they act it,” muttered Jerry.
</p>
<p>
The party arranged themselves at two tables,
keeping up a running fire of loud-toned repartee.
Signor Baretti, now seated at one end of the restaurant,
perusing an Italian newspaper, peered
sharply over it at the disturbers. The little man
knew, to a dot, the difference between natural high
spirits and boisterousness.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had they seated themselves when the tall
girl stood up and called out, “Attention, everybody!”
She waved an inclusive arm over the two
tables occupied by the flock she appeared to be
leading.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down Gussie!” giggled a small girl with very
light hair, a snub nose and freckles. “You are making
a lot of noise in the world. Didn’t you
know it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who cares.” The tall girl tossed her short-cropped
head. “Already now with the Bertram
yell. Let’s show folks where we came from. When
I raise my arm—go ahead and <em>whoop</em>!”
</p>
<p>
Highly pleased with herself and utterly regardless
of proprietor and diners, she raised a rounded
arm, bare almost to the shoulder, with a grandiose
air.
</p>
<p>
Immediately lusty voices took up a yell ending in
a long drawn “Ber-t-r-a-m! That’s us!” This was
repeated three times. As it died away the enterprising
leader resumed her chair, apparently careless
of what impression she and her companions had
made.
</p>
<p>
Two meek Italian waitresses now approaching to
take their order, they hesitated and hung back a
little. The yelling having subsided, they rose afresh
to duty and went over to the party. There they continued
to stand, unheeded by the revelers. The exuberant
freshmen now had their heads together over
the menu, babbling joyously.
</p>
<p>
“Are we ready to go?” Leila glanced inquiringly
around the circle. “Let us leave these little
folks to their merry shouts and laughter. Two of
those youngsters, the tall one and the little tow-head,
are at Wayland Hall. I mentioned them a
while back as noisy. Have you reason to doubt
me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“We could never doubt you, Leila Greatheart,”
lightly avowed Marjorie. She was eyeing the rollicking
freshmen with some amusement.
</p>
<p>
“I guess Bertram must be a prep school. Hence
the loyal howls for their little old kindergarten,”
surmised Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“They have a whole lot to learn,” smiled Vera.
“A few well-directed remarks from the faculty will
soon calm their joyous ardor. Perhaps we shouldn’t
criticize. We were rather noisy ourselves not many minutes
ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but in moderation,” reminded Jerry.
“All our rejoicing together wasn’t as loud as one
whoop from the freshies. Not that I care,” she
added genially. “I can stand it if Giuseppe can.”
</p>
<p>
“Bertram?” Lucy questioningly repeated. “Where
is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Not far from New York City,” Vera answered.
“I knew two girls who entered Vassar from there.
One of them told me it was more like an exclusive
boarding school than the regulation prep. She
called it the Baby Shop. She said the girls there
behaved like overgrown youngsters. That was four
years ago. Maybe the Bertramites have grown up
since then,” she added in her kindly way.
</p>
<p>
“Again, maybe they have not.” Leila glanced
skeptically at the Bertramites. They were now engaged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
in all trying to order at once, a proceeding
quite bewildering to their servitors.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I&nbsp;&nbsp;hate&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;get&nbsp;&nbsp;me&nbsp;&nbsp;gone&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;stars,&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;glad&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;going!”<br />
</p>
<p>
hummed Leila under her breath. “Now that is as
fine an old Irish song as you’d care to hear. Do I
shout it at the top of my breath and disturb the
peace? I do not. I keep my lilting strictly within
bounds.” For all her criticism, Leila was half
amused at the noisy freshmen.
</p>
<p>
“Subdued like, as it were,” supplemented Muriel
with a killing smile.
</p>
<p>
“You have a fine understanding.” Leila beamed
with equal exaggeration.
</p>
<p>
In this jesting mood they rose from the table.
Leila had already pounced upon the dinner check.
On the way to the cashier’s desk, they became aware
of less noise at the freshmen’s tables. The concentrated
interest of the newcomers had become centered
on the departing upperclassmen.
</p>
<p>
The gaze of the tall, dashing girl, who had led
the others in the Bertram yell was now traveling
with peculiar eagerness from face to face. Her
expression was a mixture of curiosity, defiance,
admiration and envy. Her glance rested longest on
Ronny. She devoured every detail of Ronny’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
smart tweed traveling suit, gray walking hat and
gray buckskin ties. A gleam of respect showed
itself in her bold brown eyes.
</p>
<p>
The freshman Leila had described as a “tow-head,”
after an equally deliberate inspection of the
departing group, caught the tall girl by the arm and
began a rapid flow of talk. Not for an instant as
she talked did she remove her gaze from Marjorie
and her chums.
</p>
<p>
Jerry was the first to note they were being thus
observed by the other crowd of students. A decided
scowl appeared between her brows. She always
resented being stared at.
</p>
<p>
“Those freshies have mistaken us for a part of the
exhibits in the Hamilton Museum, I guess, let loose
for an hour or two of recreation,” she grumbled.
“I object to being rubbered at. What?” She mimicked
Leslie Cairns’ affected drawl.
</p>
<p>
Her manner of expression, rather than her remarks,
induced the laughter of her companions.
Nor did she realize that she had turned her eyes
upon the freshmen as she spoke, with a look of
bored endurance far from flattering to them. Unfortunately
the tall girl happened to catch it, as well
as the ripple of laughter. Her face darkened. Her
retroussé nose elevated itself even higher.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that girl with the big brown eyes simply
gorgeous?” exclaimed a pert-looking freshman with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
shrewd black eyes. The girls they had been watching
were now out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“A regular dream of beauty,” praised another.
“Her complexion was like a magnolia petal.”
</p>
<p>
“My, but you two are crushed on that—well,
quite pretty girl,” the tall leader said in a slightly
miffed tone. “My eyes are larger than hers,” she
added.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, Gus, they certainly aren’t a bit larger,”
flatly contradicted a stolid-looking girl with eyeglasses.
</p>
<p>
“They certainly <em>are</em>,” maintained the tall girl.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t grab all the bouquets, Gus,” lazily advised
Calista Wilmot, the black-eyed girl. “Leave
a few for someone else.”
</p>
<p>
“Sha’n’t. I want ’em all myself.” The reply was
careless rather than ill-humored. “Anyhow there
was nothing startlingly beautiful about that one girl
you folks are raving over.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I think there was,” differed the freshman
with the eyeglasses, with a positiveness that courted
argument.
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose they were freshmen?” A
plump blonde girl with a pleasing face tactfully propounded
this question. Anna Perry, the stolid
freshman, and Augusta Forbes never agreed on anything.
Charlotte Robbins purposed to nip rising
argument in the bud if she could.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed,” Augusta assured. “The tall one
with the black hair is a post graduate. I inquired
about her. She rooms three doors up the hall from
Flossie and me. I haven’t seen the others before.
I don’t care to again.” A glint of wounded pride
appeared in her eyes as she made this announcement.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Gus?” demanded three or four voices.
</p>
<p>
“Because they are snippy. Didn’t you see the
disgusted way that one girl in light blue looked at
us? Much as to say, ‘Oh, those silly freshmen!’
They are all upper class girls. I don’t admire their
manners. They were making fun of us, I’m sure.
They have no time for mere freshmen.”
</p>
<p>
“Gus talks as if it were a positive crime to be a
freshman in the eyes of the upper class students.”
Calista Wilmot lifted her thin shoulders. “I’ve
always heard they go by preference rather than class
in taking up a freshman.”
</p>
<p>
“They do <em>not</em>.” Augusta seemed determined to
oppose her companions. “The juniors and seniors
at college are <em>awfully</em> high and mighty. I have
been told that they are <em>very</em> patronizing to the
freshmen. They shall not patronize <em>me</em>. I won’t
submit to it. This business of the freshmen having
to defer to upper class students is all nonsense. I
shall assert myself from the start.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>CHAPTER VI—THE REBUFF</h2>
<p>
“Leila, do you think we should have spoken to
those freshies and extended the hand of friendship?”
Marjorie inquired half doubtfully as the
party, now seven strong, loitered along their way
to the Hall. The balminess of the still September
night made them reluctant to go indoors.
</p>
<p>
“Not tonight,” Leila reassured. “Plenty of time
for that. Did I rush into your pocket the first time
I saw you, Beauty? I did not. Remember Selma,
Nella, Vera and I were at Baretti’s when you five
girls walked in there on your first evening at Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“Give us credit. We didn’t whoop like a war
party of Comanches, did we?” This from Jerry,
who had not yet brought herself to a tolerant view
of the noisy party of freshies.
</p>
<p>
“You did not. We four made more noise than
you. That was nothing compared to these Bertramites,”
Leila’s criticism held indulgence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
“You said the tall one and the ‘tow-head’ were at
the Hall. It would not surprise me to find the
whole aggregation there. The others may have
arrived while we were marching around the campus,
making calls on people who were not at home. I
see our finish.” Jerry groaned loudly. “The majority
of the sixteen freshmen Miss Remson spoke
of!”
</p>
<p>
Jerry’s surmise proved correct. The same group
of girls they had encountered at Baretti’s on the
previous evening trooped into the dining room the
next morning just as the Lookouts were finishing
their breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“The strangers within our gates,” announced
Jerry. “It’s up to us to remember ’em. What?
I’m really growing fond of that ‘What?’ I can
understand why Miss Cairns was so fond of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I think it is a foolish expression,” condemned
Muriel, her eyes twinkling.
</p>
<p>
“Then never indulge in it, my dear Miss Harding,”
cautioned Jerry. “May I venture to inquire
what the pleasure of this distinguished company is
today?”
</p>
<p>
“Unpack, if our trunks come,” returned Ronny
and Marjorie together. “I wish Helen would hurry
up and get here,” Marjorie continued. “We all
ought to go over to Hamilton Arms to see Miss Susanna.
I’d not care to go without Helen, though.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s a journey without the ninth Traveler?”
propounded Ronny. “Have you any idea when
she’ll be here?”
</p>
<p>
No one had. At eleven o’clock that morning,
however, Jerry signed for a telegram. She hustled
up stairs with it to impart the good news that
Helen Trent would arrive on the four-ten train
from the North. The trunks having been delivered
shortly before ten o’clock that morning, unpacking
was in full swing.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll all go to the station to meet her,” planned
Jerry. “Only eight of us can’t very well squeeze
into Leila’s roadster. Four of us will have to go
in a taxi.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d better call Kathie on the telephone and tell
her and Lillian to be ready,” was Marjorie’s spoken
thought. “Lillian isn’t a Traveler, but she ought
to be asked to join us. She has been so dear to
Kathie and Lucy especially, and to us, too.”
</p>
<p>
“We might as well be the Ten Travelers as the
Nine,” agreed Jerry. “I’d like Lillian to meet Miss
Susanna, wouldn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; only we can’t take her with us to Hamilton
Arms without having first explained all about
her and asked permission to bring her.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it. Do you believe our little old Travelers’
club is really important enough to leave to
Hamilton as a sorority? It was different with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
Lookout Club. We were regularly organized with
constitution and by-laws, etc. This is very informal;
secret, one might almost call it.”
</p>
<p>
“I have thought about that, too,” Marjorie replied.
“I’ve also thought we ought to ask Robin
and Portia to join—in fact the Silvertonites who
have stood by us since our freshie days. There are
Ethel Laird and Grace Dearborn, too. They have
been devoted to us.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t forget Eva Ingram and Mary Cornell,”
added Jerry. “They certainly stood by us when we
had that row with the Sans during our freshman
year.”
</p>
<p>
“I meant to count them in,” Marjorie nodded.
“Once, this past summer, I made a list of names.
There were nineteen, counting the original nine of
us. I didn’t count Phil or Anna Towne or Barbara
Severn. They are still to come. If we leave the
club as a sorority to the next senior class, they will
be the first girls chosen.”
</p>
<p>
“The Nineteen Travelers.” Jerry critically tried
out the title. “That sounds as well as the Nine Travelers.
I don’t know but better.”
</p>
<p>
“We really need the whole nineteen if we are
really going to accomplish laying a foundation for
a dormitory,” was Marjorie’s energetic declaration.
“I mean that figuratively. If we manage to get the
site for a dormitory this year we’ll have done well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
We don’t even know whether those boarding house
properties are for sale.”
</p>
<p>
“If they aren’t, we might find another site, even
better. There is plenty of open ground below
them.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but it belongs to the Carden Estate and
isn’t for sale. I asked Miss Susanna about it last
June. She knows all about the land near the college
and Hamilton Estates. She explained to me
the reason for that row of houses along that little
street. You know we wondered why they were
there.”
</p>
<p>
“It always looked to me as though a couple of
city blocks of third rate houses had been picked up
and dumped down just outside the campus limits
for no particular reason,” was Jerry’s view of it.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there’s a reason,” smiled Marjorie. “The
workmen who built Hamilton College lived in those
houses while the work was in progress. It took
almost five years to build our Alma Mater, Jeremiah.
By the workmen, I mean the foremen and
more important of the builders. I don’t know
where the laborers lived. In the town of Hamilton,
I presume. Those houses were considered very sizable
and comfortable in Mr. Brooke Hamilton’s day,
Miss Susanna said.”
</p>
<p>
As the two busied themselves with their unpacking,
they continued to talk over the project of enlarging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
their little circle to nineteen members. Until
their particular allies had returned to Hamilton
nothing could be done.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until college has opened, then I’ll call a
meeting. We’d best have it in Leila’s and Vera’s
room. It is larger than ours. Between you and
me, Jeremiah, what ought we to do about the
freshies?” Marjorie straightened from her trunk,
her arms full of wearing apparel, and stared dubiously
at Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“What?” This time the ejaculation came involuntarily.
On her knees before her trunk, Jerry’s
head and plump shoulders had been temporarily
eclipsed, as she dived into the trunk to fish up the
few remaining articles at the bottom. “Oh, yes, I
got you.” Jerry had comprehended a second after
Marjorie had spoken.
</p>
<p>
“What you said at breakfast about the strangers
being well within our gates, made me feel that we
ought to begin to try to get acquainted with them.
We promised Miss Remson to help them get settled,
if we could. I don’t mind their being noisy.” Marjorie
paused.
</p>
<p>
Jerry eyed her quizzically. “You think they are
too much like the Sans to be a positive comfort
around the house, now don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“They seemed a little that way to me,” Marjorie
admitted. “The Sans were older by a year or two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
than these girls when they entered Hamilton. These
freshies are very juvenile acting.”
</p>
<p>
“They acted last night as though they didn’t care
a button whether they met anyone else or not. A
sufficient-unto-themselves crowd, you know. Still,
if we hold off from them, they may feel that we are
puffed up over our senior estate. The best way, I
guess, is to cultivate them. We can be friendly, but
a trifle on our dignity at the same time.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll probably meet them in the halls and on
the veranda during the next day or so. That will
start the ball rolling. I’d rather not make any calls
until I’ve had one or two chance encounters with
some of them. Being on station duty is different.
It is a detail.”
</p>
<p>
“I hate to butt into a stranger’s room, freshie or
no freshie,” Jerry agreed. “You know how we felt
when the three Sans came to call before we had
hardly taken off our hats.”
</p>
<p>
In spite of Marjorie’s ever ready willingness to
be of service when needed, she still retained a certain
amount of shyness which had been hers as a
child.
</p>
<p>
“I am not afraid of being snubbed by these lively
freshie children,” she presently said, with a trace of
humor. “I don’t care to intrude on them unless I
am truly sure they want to know us.”
</p>
<p>
“They don’t know what they want or what they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
don’t want,” calmly observed Jerry. “I am not enthusiastic
over them, Marvelous Manager. I’ll try
to be a conscientious elder sister to them, but it will
be an awful struggle.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie laughed at this. Jerry chuckled faintly
in unison. The unexpected invasion of Lucy, Katherine
Langly and Lillian Wenderblatt put an end
to confidence. The will to labor also languished
and was lost in the ardor of meeting and greeting.
</p>
<p>
Invited to stay to luncheon, the ringing of the
bell found Jerry’s and Marjorie’s room in a state
of temporary disorder. Every available space was
piled with feminine effects.
</p>
<p>
“Things are in an awful uproar.” Jerry waved
her arm over the chaotic array. “The worst is over
with our unpacking done. It won’t take long after
luncheon to put this stuff where it belongs. Glad
you girls came to the Hall. It saves us the trouble
of going after you.”
</p>
<p>
Ronny and Muriel now appearing, the seven girls
went happily down to luncheon. As a result of
Jerry’s and Marjorie’s talk regarding the freshman
arrivals at Wayland Hall, both were prepared to be
conscientiously friendly on sight.
</p>
<p>
A trifle ahead of their companions in descending
the stairs, at the foot of the staircase they encountered
Augusta Forbes, Calista Wilmot and Florence
Hart, the “tow-head,” just entering the hall from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
the veranda. The eyes of the two sets of girls met
for an instant. Marjorie smiled in friendly, unaffected
fashion, intending to speak. Jerry emulated
her example. To their surprise Augusta Forbes put
on an expression of extreme hauteur; Florence Hart
stared icily out of two pale blue eyes. Calista Wilmot,
however, smiled cheerfully, taking no notice of
her companions’ frozen attitude.
</p>
<p>
It was all done in a second or two. Marjorie’s
color heightened. She felt as though she had received
a slap in the face. The smile fleeing from
her lips, she treated the haughty pair to a steady,
searching glance. Then she quietly withdrew her
gaze.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>CHAPTER VII—MAKING SURE PROGRESS</h2>
<p>
“Now what was the matter with them?” Jerry
demanded, as she and Marjorie entered the dining
room. “Were we properly snubbed? No mistake
about it. They must have heard what I said about
them last night.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t recall that you said anything very dreadful
about them,” returned Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“I compared them to Comanches and expressed
my general disapproval of their howls,” confessed
Jerry cheerfully. “Only they didn’t hear me say
anything. Leila said as much as I. Neither of us
meant to be ill-natured. You know I usually say
outright whatever I think in a case of that kind.”
</p>
<p>
“Those two freshies acted as though they were
angry with us for some unknown reason or other.”
Marjorie knitted her brows. “They’d hardly have
behaved like that simply because they didn’t know
us and resented our smiling at them on that account.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“That <em>would</em> be the height of snobbishness,” replied
Jerry. “We’d better tell the girls. They may
try to be helpful and get a snubbing, same as we
did.”
</p>
<p>
Seated at table, Jerry proceeded to tell the others
of the incident. Be it said to her credit she made
no attempt to retail it as gossip. She bluntly stated
what had happened and warned them to keep their
helpfulness at home.
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad,” Lillian Wenderblatt said sympathetically.
“It puts you all at sea as to what to
do next. You say the one girl returned your smile.
Perhaps when you know her better you can find out
what ails the other two.”
</p>
<p>
“They can’t have a grievance against us when
they don’t know us,” Marjorie said. “I shall let
those two alone for the present and confine my attention
to some of the other freshies.”
</p>
<p>
With this she dropped the incident from her
thought and speech. After luncheon, as she redressed
her hair to go to the station, it recurred to
her disagreeably. She half formed the guess that
Elizabeth Walbert might have made the acquaintance
already of these two freshmen and prejudiced
them against herself and her friends. Miss Walbert
could not possibly have a just grievance against her.
Their acquaintance had been too brief. As a former
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
friend of Leslie Cairns, however, she probably held
rancor against the Lookouts.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie sturdily dismissed this conjecture as not
in keeping with her principles. She felt it unfair
to accuse Elizabeth Walbert, even in thought, of
such an act. She resolved to take Lillian Wenderblatt’s
advice and cultivate the acquaintance of the
black-eyed girl who had shown signs of affability.
She might then, eventually, learn wherein lay the
difficulty.
</p>
<p>
A rollicking afternoon with her chums, crowded
with meeting and welcoming at least twenty seniors
who had returned to college on the same train as
Helen Trent, drove the disquieting incident from
her mind. Helen was the last one of the nine girls,
who had long been intimate friends, to return to
Hamilton. Lillian now added as the tenth “Traveler,”
the band of friends were in high feather.
Helen was triumphantly escorted to the Lotus from
the station and there feted and made much of. Arriving
at ten minutes past four o’clock, it was after
six before she saw the inside of Wayland Hall.
Three rounds of ices apiece had also dampened the
ardor of all concerned for dinner.
</p>
<p>
“These joyful ice cream sociables are appetite
killers. There goes the dinner gong and yours truly
is listening to it without a snark of enthusiasm. I
think I’ll forego dinner and finish straightening my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
traps,” declared Jerry. Now returned to her room,
Jerry viewed her still scattered possessions with distinct
disfavor.
</p>
<p>
“You had better go down and eat something,”
advised Marjorie. “You will be ravenous about
bedtime, if you don’t. We haven’t a thing here to
eat except candy. As a late feed it’s conducive of
nightmares, Jeremiah.”
</p>
<p>
“Wise and thoughtful Mentor, so it is,” grinned
Jerry. “I’ll take your advice.”
</p>
<p>
“If I see that black-eyed girl who smiled at me
downstairs I shall speak to her and start things
moving,” Marjorie said with decision. “I won’t ask
her the very first thing what was the matter with
her friends, but I’ll do so as soon as I am a little
bit acquainted with her.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie found no opportunity to put her resolve
into execution that evening. The freshman in question
was seated at a table the length of the room
from the one at which she sat. The two freshmen
who had shown such utter hauteur had seats at the
same table as their black-eyed friend. Marjorie had
not even an opportunity to catch the other girl’s eye.
</p>
<p>
The following morning, as she started across the
campus with Ronny for a stroll and a talk in the
warm early autumn sunshine, fortune favored her.
Seated on a rustic bench under a huge elm tree were
two of the freshmen she was anxious to come into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
touch with. One was the black-eyed girl, the other
the plump blonde.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a splendid opportunity, Ronny.” Marjorie
took Ronny by the arm. “Come along. I am going
to speak to them. No time like the present, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, lead the way.” Ronny obligingly
allowed Marjorie to propel her toward the bench
where the duo were seated.
</p>
<p>
“Good morning.” Marjorie stopped fairly in
front of the rustic seat, her brown eyes alight with
gentle friendliness. “Isn’t the campus wonderful
today? This is one of its happy moods. I always
say it changes in expression just as persons do.”
</p>
<p>
“Good morning.” The black-eyed girl’s tones
were as friendly as her own had been. The fair-haired
girl also acknowledged the greeting with a
nod and smile. “Truly, I agree with you. I think
this campus is the most magnificent piece of lawn I
ever saw or expect to see.”
</p>
<p>
“I see where the good old campus has made another
friend.” Ronny now broke into the conversation
nicely started between Marjorie and the freshmen.
“Marjorie, this person here,” Ronny playfully
indicated her chum, “calls it her oldest friend at
Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t wonder. I hadn’t thought of it in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
light before,” returned the blonde freshman half
shyly.
</p>
<p>
Both freshmen showed a certain pleasure mingled
with reserve in having thus been addressed by the
two seniors.
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t mind, I am going to bring that
seat over there up beside yours.” Marjorie promptly
got into action. “Then we can all have a sunny
morning confab. It is high time we began to get
acquainted with our little sisters,” she finished
laughingly.
</p>
<p>
Together she and Ronny carried the nearby seat
to a place beside the one holding the two freshmen.
Then conversation began afresh, a trifle stiffly at
first. Soon the four were laughing merrily over
Calista Wilmot’s humorous narration of her first
day at Bertram Preparatory School when the taxicab
driver had, at the start, misunderstood her and
carried her to the opposite end of the borough in
which the school was situated.
</p>
<p>
“He landed me with a flourish in front of the
main entrance to the Bertram Academy for young
men,” she related. “I saw a crowd of young men
playing football on a side lawn. That was queer,
I thought. I didn’t see a sign of a single girl. He
set my luggage down on the drive. In another
minute he would have been off and away. I had
paid him before we started. I called out to him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
wait and asked him if he was sure it was the Bertram
Preparatory School for Girls. Right then we
came to an understanding. Maybe I didn’t drive
away from that school in a hurry. I had a perfect
string of mishaps that day, big and little.” She
continued to relate them to her amused listeners.
</p>
<p>
An hour slipped away unheeded by the congenial
quartette under the big elm. Marjorie made no
approach to the subject on her mind. The two
freshmen asked numerous impersonal questions regarding
Hamilton College and its traditions. They
made but scant reference to their own friends except
to remark that there were twelve of them at Wayland
Hall.
</p>
<p>
“Look, Ronny.” Marjorie pointed to the chimes
clock in the chapel tower which showed eleven.
“We must go. I promised to go over to Silverton
Hall to see Robin Page before luncheon. We’ll
have time just for a hurried call.”
</p>
<p>
To her new acquaintances she explained: “Miss
Page is a very dear friend. She came back to Hamilton
on the seven-thirty train last night. Would
you like to go with us to Silverton Hall? I am
sure she will be glad to meet you.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls, thus invited, exchanged eager
glances. It was evident both wished very much to
go. Still, for some reason, they hesitated to accept.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know—” began Calista doubtfully. “Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
today, I think.” She adopted a tone of sudden
decision.
</p>
<p>
“Some other day, I hope,” supplemented Charlotte
Robbins, the blonde girl. She looked almost
appealingly at Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“Any day,” was Marjorie’s cordial response.
“My room, or rather Miss Macy’s and my room is
15. Delighted to be of service to you. Miss Lynne
and I will make you a real call some evening this
week.”
</p>
<p>
“Our number is 20. I hope you <em>will</em> come and
see us.” Charlotte Robbins emphasized the will as
though she had definitely made up her mind to be
cordial.
</p>
<p>
After Marjorie and Ronny had left them, the
two freshmen regarded each other in silence for a
moment.
</p>
<p>
“Now we have gone and done it!” exclaimed
Charlotte with a short laugh. “What else could we
have done?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” replied Calista with conviction. “Gus
is going to be as cross as two sticks. She is so
stubborn, once she makes up her mind to be.”
</p>
<p>
“She has made a mistake about Miss Dean and
Miss Lynne, at least. They are sweet.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to quarrel with Gussie over this
business.” Calista knitted reflective brows. “In
spite of the numerous wordy tilts she and I are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
always having, I’m awfully fond of Gus. A more
generous girl never lived, and she is so square, too.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s the baby who wouldn’t grow up,” Charlotte
said with a whimsical smile. “She’s good as
gold when she wants to be good. She roars like a
spoiled infant when she is crossed. The best way
to do is to stand by the courage of our convictions.
We like these two seniors. They appear to like us.
We’ll just have to make Gus understand that.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>CHAPTER VIII—FAITHLESS FRIENDS</h2>
<p>
“Leslie Cairns! The very last person I expected
to see in this part of the country!”
</p>
<p>
With this exclamation of amazement, Lola Elster
brought the small electric machine she was driving
to a quick stop. The surprised cry was the result
of being hailed by a young woman driving a roadster.
The latter had spied the electric motor containing
Alida Burton and Lola Elster and promptly
raised her voice to a shout of greeting. The meeting
occurring on one of the staid residence avenues
of Hamilton, she had had no difficulty in attracting
the attention of the two seniors.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Leslie, this <em>is</em> a surprise!” echoed Alida.
“I haven’t seen you since the day—” Alida stopped,
her color rising. “I mean since—” again she stammered.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, say it and be done with it.” Leslie exhibited
her old impatience. She was already shaking
hands with Lola, who had climbed out of the electric
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
and now stood beside the roadster. “Since I
got it in the neck for hazing. That’s what the
trouble was all about. If Matthews hadn’t been
both feet down on hazing the whole thing would
have blown over.”
</p>
<p>
“We couldn’t imagine what had become of you,”
Lola said hastily. She was anxious to keep off the
subject of the Sans’ downfall. She had exhibited so
little sympathy for Leslie during her last week on
the campus that she feared Leslie might, given the
opportunity, upbraid her for her lack of loyalty.
“Why didn’t you write me, Leslie? I never heard
a word from you all summer.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I was busy. I don’t like to write letters.”
The reply was coolly evasive.
</p>
<p>
“Are you staying in town?” Alida was now out
of the car and ranged next to Lola beside the roadster.
</p>
<p>
“West Hamilton. I have an aunt there, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?” Lola opened her eyes. “I never
knew that.”
</p>
<p>
Conversation languished for an instant. Lola
and Alida were both curious concerning Leslie, but
tried not to show it.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a rather nice little confectioner’s store
about two blocks further down the street. Suppose
we go there,” proposed Leslie. “We are blocking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
the road, as it is. Some of these Hamilton fossils
would kick if we happened to take up an inch more
of room than their ideas call for.”
</p>
<p>
“I know the place you mean. Delighted!” Lola
turned toward her car, Alida following. Again at
the wheel, she called out, “Park your car on the
lower side of the street opposite the shop. The
parking’s better there. Go ahead. We’ll be right
behind you.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure thing,” Leslie returned laconically. “I
know all about that place.”
</p>
<p>
“Leslie has nerve,” was Lola’s first remark out
of the former’s hearing. “If I had been expelled
from college you wouldn’t catch me within a hundred
miles of the fatal spot afterward. First I ever
heard she had an aunt in West Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you believe it?” queried Alida.
</p>
<p>
“I doubt it. Les is here for some special reason
of her own which she will keep to herself unless she
happens to feel confidential. I understand her. She
used to tell me a lot about her affairs when I was a
freshie. After you and I grew pally, she grew shut-mouth,”
Lola slangily continued. “I was glad not
to be her pal. She took too many risks and she was
always dragging her pals into trouble. She thought
money would help her out all the time. You see for
yourself, it didn’t. I made up my mind to keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
away from Les long before the end of my freshman
year.”
</p>
<p>
“She thought a lot of you, though, Lola. She
really did,” Alida said earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know.” Lola made a little bored movement
of the head. “After she mixed things up for me
and made me appear an idiot at basketball, I had
had enough of being chummy with her. Be careful
what you say to her today. Les has some kind of
game to play, take it from me. Don’t be too
friendly with her. It won’t add to our reputation
as seniors to be chummy with her. We’ll have to
keep her at a distance. Recall she left Hamilton,
<em>disgraced</em>.”
</p>
<p>
The confectioner’s shop reached, Lola had time
for no more advice. Natalie Weyman had once
characterized Lola Elster to Leslie as “a selfish kid.”
In all ways she bore out this opinion. She was
constantly alive to her own interests, always placed
them first, and callously trampled down anyone who
stood in the way of them.
</p>
<p>
The trio presently established at one of the small
round tables and their order given for soda fountain
concoctions composed of ice cream, nuts and
fruit syrup, Leslie said with an elaborate attempt at
indifference, “Well, what is the news from the
knowledge shop? Have you seen Walbert yet?”
</p>
<p>
“She’s at Wayland Hall,” promptly replied Alida.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
“So are we. Lola and I room together now.” Satisfaction
permeated the information.
</p>
<p>
“What?” Leslie made the monosyllable faintly
satiric. “You don’t say so. And Walbert is at the
Hall! She tried long and hard enough to get there.
So did you, Lola. Where Walbert should be is off
the campus. She deserved the run far more than
we.”
</p>
<p>
“We are awfully provoked about it,” went on
Alida. “We do not intend to bother with her at
all. Do we, Lola?”
</p>
<p>
Lola shrugged contemptuously. “I sha’n’t lose
any sleep over her. I never liked her.”
</p>
<p>
“You never lost any sleep over admiration for
anyone, Lola.” Leslie put a touch of malice in the
assertion.
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” Lola replied boldly, though she reddened.
She understood the remark to be a reproach.
</p>
<p>
“How is Bean, dear creature?” Leslie simulated
effusion. “And how are the beanstalks? Grown
clear up to the chapel steeple by this time, I don’t
doubt.”
</p>
<p>
“They are back. That’s about all I can say. We
aren’t on speaking terms with them, you know. By
the way, Les, did Bean stand up before the Board
and refuse to answer their questions? I mean last
spring when the Sans got in bad. I heard she did.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who told you?” countered Leslie, her face darkening.
</p>
<p>
“Nell Ray, I think. It was one of the Sans,”
Lola informed.
</p>
<p>
“I always knew Nell Ray was a talker.” Leslie
scowled her disapproval. “Yes, you may as well
know, Bean did precisely that. It was merely a
bluff. I think she had told the whole thing to
Matthews before we were summoned. Very likely
he sent for her when he received Dulcie’s letter.
She spilled the story of the hazing and he agreed
to let her get away with refusing to talk before the
Board. That little prig made more trouble for me
than anyone else at Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think so, Leslie,” differed Lola. “It was
Dulcie Vale and Bess who dished you. You always
had it in for Bean and she never made a move
against you.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know what I know, or you wouldn’t
say that. But it doesn’t matter. I’ll have a chance
yet to even my score with that mischief maker. I’m
glad I ran across you two. You can keep me posted
as to what goes on at the prissy school; provided
anything of account happens there.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, certainly.” Lola’s assurance lacked warmth.
“How long do you expect to be here, Leslie? Are
you going to open your New York house this winter?
Now that you are done with college, I suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
your father will want you to be near him. If you’re
going to be in New York, Alicia and I will arrange
to spend Thanksgiving with you. Our house is
closed and the folks gone to California for the
winter.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know where I’ll be at Thanksgiving.”
Leslie spoke with cold abruptness. She had quickly
sensed Lola’s lack of interest in herself, immediately
topped by self-seeking. That was Lola to a
T. “My father and I are on the outs, if you care
to know it. He was furious with me about that
hazing business. He didn’t care a bit about what
we did to Remson. He said that was merely looking
out for our own interests. He couldn’t see the
hazing for a minute. I’m living on my own money.
I don’t know whether he and I will ever make up or
not.” A curious expression of gloom crossed her
heavy features. The estrangement from her father
was her real punishment.
</p>
<p>
“I shall stay on here for awhile,” she went on.
“I might as well. Later I’ll go to Chicago, perhaps.
I have a couple of girl friends who are crazy to have
me make them a long visit.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry about your trouble with your father.”
Lola did not show sympathy. Instead she appeared
half sulky. Leslie’s refusal to take up her Thanksgiving
hint had displeased her. She had calculated
that she and Alida would enjoy being entertained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
over Thanksgiving at the Cairns’ palatial New York
home.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’ll get over it. I am his only child. He’ll
have to come across with a forgiveness diploma
sooner or later. It’s the only kind of diploma I
want.”
</p>
<p>
For half an hour longer the three sat around the
table, their talk animated but fragmentary, so far as
sticking to one subject was concerned. During that
time Lola kept her ears trained for some catch word
that might explain Leslie’s presence in Hamilton.
Leslie, however, was on her guard. When at
length they rose to leave the shop, she had arrived
at one definite conclusion. She could not count on
the friendship of either girl. Alida would be ruled
by Lola, and Lola would cut her dead tomorrow if
self-interest warranted it.
</p>
<p>
Leslie Cairns had deceived them in saying she
was visiting an aunt in Hamilton. She had merely
taken a furnished house in the town and was living
there with a chaperon whom she called “Aunt
Edith.” Leslie was wise enough to know that, after
her separation from her father, she could not defy
convention with success. As a young woman alone,
she needed the protection of a chaperon. She therefore
engaged the services of a middle-aged woman
of education and social standing who had met with
reverses of fortune. Mrs. Gaylord, her duenna,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
never interfered with her plans. She placidly fell
in with them.
</p>
<p>
As it happened, Leslie’s father had not entirely
abandoned his unscrupulous daughter. He had determined
to teach her a lesson. Shocked at her lawless
conduct and bitterly incensed and disappointed
at her expulsion from Hamilton College, he had
treated her with great harshness. He had bitterly
reminded her of his threat to disown her. “You
have your own money,” he had said. “Use it to support
yourself. I wish nothing more to do with you.
I am going to Chicago for a week. When I come
back, I shall expect to find you gone.”
</p>
<p>
Characteristic of Leslie, she had accepted the verdict
without emotion. She had packed her effects,
engaged a chaperon from a private agency, and left
New York for Bar Harbor for the summer. Mr.
Cairns had had her every movement secretly
watched, however. Mrs. Alice Gaylord would not
have chaperoned Leslie long had his private seal of
approval been lacking. Assured that she was in
safe company, he left her to her own devices until
such time as he should find it in his heart to reclaim
her.
</p>
<p>
The summer over, Leslie had found time hanging
heavily on her hands. She had had altogether too
much time to think, and thinking grew into brooding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
over her deserved misfortunes. Strangely
enough, she blamed Marjorie Dean more than all
the others for what had happened. She chose to
do so because she had never forgiven Marjorie for
turning on her on the occasion when Leslie had led
the verbal affront against Marjorie on the campus
during the latter’s freshman year. With that for a
basis, she had laid the failure of every dishonorable
scheme she had concocted at Hamilton at Marjorie’s
door. It was the old story of the injurer accusing
the innocent injured party of treachery.
</p>
<p>
Shortly before her expulsion from Hamilton College,
Leslie heard a rumor to which she paid no
special attention on hearing. In the stress of the
dismissal agony she forgot about it. Later it returned
to her. It was the recollection of it which
decided her to take up her residence in the town of
Hamilton. She also had a certain amount of curiosity
regarding what went on at Hamilton. Lola
and Alida were still there. She had thought she
might cultivate their society.
</p>
<p>
Leslie was shrewd enough to discern, that, while
Lola Elster would gladly accept entertainment from
her in New York, she was not desirous of the old
campus intimacy with her.
</p>
<p>
Back in her roadster, having bade the two seniors
a nonchalant farewell with, “I’ll lunch you at my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
aunt’s house some day soon,” she drove down the
shady street half hurt, half amused.
</p>
<p>
“Lola’s the same greedy, grabbing kid,” she reflected.
“That settles both of them for me. I
couldn’t depend upon them to find out a thing for
me. Bess Walbert is anything but trustworthy.
Still I may have to make up with her yet.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>CHAPTER IX—CLEARING AWAY SNAGS</h2>
<p>
Marjorie had fully intended to fathom the mystery
of the two freshmen’s apparent grudge against
Jerry and herself without delay. Pressure of college
affairs, social and scholastic, prevented the solving
of the annoying problem. The return of the Silvertonites
kept the Ten Travelers constantly traveling
back and forth between Wayland and Silverton
Halls. With the return of Phyllis Moore, the Moore
Symphony Orchestra made itself heard about the
campus on moonlight evenings. Almost every night
for a week serenading went on.
</p>
<p>
During the days the two sets of girls took turns
doing station duty. The freshman class was larger
than ever before. One hundred and forty-three
freshmen were registered. Every available room in
the campus houses had been taken and a few boarding
houses off the campus were well filled.
</p>
<p>
“It seems too bad we don’t know our own freshies
as well as we know some of the others,” deplored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
Marjorie one evening about two weeks after the
opening of college. “I have hardly seen those two
girls, Miss Wilmot and Miss Robbins, since the
morning Ronny and I talked to them on the
campus. One can’t count seeing them at meals,
because, then, they’re too far away to talk with.
I went down to call on them twice. Once, they
weren’t there, and the other time they had a ‘Busy’
sign up.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t been near them. I suppose I should
have made a call, but I was anxious for you to
break the ice. I am a timid little thing, you know,”
Jerry ended with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I shall make a third attempt this evening,”
decided Marjorie. “Phil says the sophs are talking
about giving the frolic earlier this year. There are
so many freshies the sophs think they ought to
hurry and make them feel at home. That means
some of the juniors and seniors to the rescue. The
sophs are in the minority again.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall you play escort?” asked Jerry. “If you do,
then I’m in for it, too. ‘Whither thou goest.’ You
get me?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I get you. I’ll do escort duty if I’m asked.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be asked, all right enough,” Jerry predicted.
“Do you need me to help you make calls
this evening?”
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would go. You haven’t met Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
Wilmot or Miss Robbins yet. We will go and see
them soon after dinner. I have a hard Philology
lesson ahead of me this evening and must study.
So we mustn’t stay long.”
</p>
<p>
“I notice Miss Walbert is very chummy with
that last lot of freshies who came here,” observed
Jerry. “Funny, the freshies here are divided into
two crowds. There’s that first crowd of twelve.
The other six, the ones who seem to admire Miss
Walbert, are another close corporation. Neither
crowd appears to exchange much friendliness. It’s
a case of once we used to be snobbish at Wayland
Hall, but now we’re clannish. Our own gang is
just about as clannish as the others. That ain’t no
way to be sociable, is it?”
</p>
<p>
“No, it ain’t,” laughed Marjorie, repeating
Jerry’s intentional lapse from correct English.
“We’ll have to see what we can do toward amendment.”
</p>
<p>
Shortly after dinner that evening, Marjorie and
Jerry paused before Room Number 20. Marjorie
rapped lightly. Sound of voices from within proclaimed
the fact that the two freshmen were at
home.
</p>
<p>
“Why, good evening,” Charlotte Robbins greeted
the pair with apparent surprise. “Won’t you come
in? We—we thought you had forgotten us,” she
added, flushing a little.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have been here twice before.” Marjorie went
on to explain the non-success of her former calls.
“I preferred not to bother you when you were with
your friends. I have brought my room-mate, Miss
Macy, with me.” She introduced Jerry and the two
girls accepted the chairs politely offered them. Marjorie
sensed a subtle change from the former
friendly attitude the freshmen had exhibited on the
campus that morning.
</p>
<p>
Jerry was distinctly ill at ease, though she strove
to be placidly agreeable. She was mentally ticketing
their call as a “freeze-out.” She had already
vowed within herself that this should be her last
effort to cultivate this particular crowd of freshmen.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie, meanwhile, was trying to make pleasant
headway against an intangible barrier. It had
not been there on that first sunny morning of
acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of a lukewarm conversation concerning
college matters, the door was suddenly flung
open. A tall girl in a baby-blue silk kimono breezed
in. She was well over the threshold before she took
in the situation. With an “Oh, excuse me! Didn’t
know you had company,” she bolted. The sarcastic
emphasis on the word “company” brought a
flush to the faces of the guests.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t mind Gussie,” apologized Calista,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
looking vexed. “She has a habit of bolting in and
out like a young hurricane. We are used to her.
She is a fine girl, but sometimes she—” Calista
broke off in confusion.
</p>
<p>
There was an embarrassing moment of silence,
shattered by Marjorie’s clear purposeful tones.
</p>
<p>
“Since you have mentioned your friend, I should
like to ask you if you know her grievance against us.
We, Miss Macy and I, have thought she must have
one. The way she spoke just now confirms it. We
know of no reason for it. It is too bad. We have
the very kindliest feeling toward the Bertram
freshies.”
</p>
<p>
“There; what did I tell you?” Instead of answering
Marjorie, Calista turned in triumph to
Charlotte.
</p>
<p>
Charlotte nodded. “I think we had best tell Miss
Dean the whole thing,” she declared. “You go
ahead, Cally. I’ll put in the Selahs at the appropriate
moments.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, and glad to get it off my chest.” Calista
breathed a long sigh. “First, please tell me, did
you say anything against us, Augusta Forbes in particular,
on the evening at Baretti’s. Augusta’s the
girl who was just here.”
</p>
<p>
“We spoke of you and the noise you were making,
but only in amusement,” Marjorie returned
with candor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“Gus declares you were making fun of her as you
walked toward the door. She says Miss Macy said
something about her that made you all laugh.”
Calista regarded Marjorie searchingly as though to
plumb her honesty.
</p>
<p>
“We did laugh at Jeremiah.” Marjorie unconsciously
used the name Jerry most often received
from her chums. “She made a funny remark about
you girls staring at her. She hates being stared at
about as much as anyone I ever knew. It wasn’t
what she said so much as the way she said it that
made us laugh. We weren’t making fun of you.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish you could make Gus believe that,” Charlotte
said. “She has taken the matter to heart and
is down on you. We were so pleased to know you
that morning under the trees. Then you promised
to come and see us and when you didn’t we thought
you didn’t care to bother with us. Besides,” she
hesitated, then went on straightforwardly, “someone
told us that you made a fuss over a freshie one
day and cut her the next. It’s horrid to have to
say these things, but I would like to have you know
about them.”
</p>
<p>
“Frankly, we haven’t wished to believe them,”
interposed Calista. “We hope to be friends with
you, Miss Dean, and with Miss Lynne and Miss
Macy. We have heard quite a little of your popularity
on the campus. It isn’t because of that we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
wish to know you. It’s because we like you.
There!”
</p>
<p>
“Much obliged.” Marjorie put out her hand.
“We felt the same about you two girls. I am so
sorry Miss Forbes is down on us. Please tell her
for me that we wish to be her friends.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know how anyone can say Marjorie is
anything but friendly and sincere,” Jerry broke
forth in protest. “I have a strong inkling as to
<em>where</em> that remark came from.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie looked quickly toward Jerry. Occupied
with the nature of Miss Forbes’ grievance she had
not grasped the other charge against herself to the
full.
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t asked to keep the person’s name a
secret,” Charlotte assured. “It was Miss Walbert
who said it. She has been in our room several
times. I don’t like her at all. I wish she would
not come here.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you please tell me again what Miss Walbert
said of me?” Marjorie quietly requested.
</p>
<p>
Charlotte repeated that portion of her former
statement concerning the charge against Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“I never cut anyone unless that person cuts me
first. I would not speak to one who did not wish to
speak to me,” Marjorie defended, the soft curves of
her lips straightening.
</p>
<p>
“She has harked back to her first day at the station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
when she came here a freshie,” asserted Jerry,
“only she has purposely twisted the truth.” Briefly
she cited the true circumstances.
</p>
<p>
“I think it is outrageous in a girl to so abuse the
truth,” declared Charlotte in shocked tones. “That
settles Miss Walbert for me.”
</p>
<p>
“And for me,” seconded Calista. “I am glad we
had it out with you.” She smiled winningly at
Marjorie. “We will try and win Gus over. Now
let us shake hands all around and swear fealty.”
</p>
<p>
This done amid good-natured laughter, the last
chill upon friendliness disappeared, never to return,
and the quartette went on to pleasanter things.
</p>
<p>
“I knew that Miss Walbert would try to start
something,” were Jerry’s first words to Marjorie
on returning to their room. “I certainly put my
foot in it by making foolish remarks. I have
thought over what I said about those girls taking
us for museum exhibits, etc. It doesn’t sound well
when repeated. I was afraid you’d feel that you
ought to repeat it, but you did nobly, Marj, nobly.
Those two girls are sensible. They didn’t split
hairs over it. All I hope is that Haughty Gus won’t
remember what I say. If she insists on knowing
what I said before she forgives me, I’ll stay unforgiven.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>CHAPTER X—A WRATHFUL AWAKENING</h2>
<p>
Despite the good offices of her chums as peace
makers, Haughty Gus, as Jerry had privately named
Augusta Forbes, refused to be placated.
</p>
<p>
“They were making fun of me, I <em>know</em>,” she persisted.
“You can’t say anything that will make me
change my opinion.” This to Calista Wilmot, who
had endeavored to reason with her.
</p>
<p>
“Talk with Miss Dean yourself, Gus,” calmly
advised Charlotte. “You will find out in about two
minutes that she is a perfect darling. Miss Macy is
nice, too. Both of those girls are true blue.”
</p>
<p>
“You and Flossie act like a couple of geese about
those seniors,” criticized Anna Perry, who chanced
to be present at the discussion.
</p>
<p>
“The two sensitive plants.” Charlotte indicated
Gussie and Florence with a wave of the hand.
</p>
<p>
It being a rainy Saturday afternoon, the five girls
were sitting about Calista’s and Charlotte’s room
drinking the fruit lemonade which Calista had just
finished making.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
Augusta and Florence both giggled at Charlotte’s
fling, by no means offended.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t care,” defied Gussie. “When I am sore
at anyone it is because I have good reason to be.
No one can ridicule me and get away with it.”
</p>
<p>
“You talk like an offended potentate, Gus,”
Calista told her.
</p>
<p>
“Why shouldn’t I, if I want to?” Gussie demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Why? Because you are a lowly freshman. You
ought to be meek along with the lowly; only you
aren’t.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess not. Don’t intend to be ever. I am just
as important in my own way as any of those old
seniors.”
</p>
<p>
“No, you are not,” Calista contradicted with
great decision. “None of us are—yet. Those girls
have three more years of accomplishment to their
credit than we. That’s the way I look at it. Besides,
I hear they are the best-liked crowd on the
campus. Miss Dean is considered the sweetest,
kindest girl at Hamilton. Miss Lynne is a wonderful
dancer. All of them have something especial
they are noted and prized for in college. They
have done noteworthy things. We are lucky to be
noticed by them.”
</p>
<p>
“Not when they merely notice us to poke fun at
us,” persisted Gussie stubbornly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“You are hopeless.” Calista threw up her hands
in despair. “You will have to learn the truth of
what I’ve said for yourself. I see that plainly.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll never learn it, for I don’t see things as you
do, at all,” Gussie retorted, determined to have the
last word.
</p>
<p>
A few days afterward Augusta announced
proudly at the dinner table that she had been invited
to the freshman frolic. She was greatly
elated to find that she had been the first of the
group of five Bertram girls, who usually kept together,
to be invited to the merry-making. More,
she crowed over the fact that her escort-to-be was a
junior. Announcing, however, that it was Elizabeth
Walbert who had invited her, she met with the
disapproval of Calista and Charlotte.
</p>
<p>
“How could you accept, Gus?” reproached Calista.
“You know how that girl misrepresented Miss
Dean to us. Of course, I <em>know</em> you have a grudge
against Miss Dean. <em>I</em> am sure Miss Dean is truthful.
I am positive Miss Walbert <em>isn’t</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t really know much about Miss Dean,”
sputtered Gussie, growing angry. “You only think
you do. I wish you wouldn’t mention that girl’s
name to me. She makes me tired, and so do you.
If Miss Walbert isn’t truthful, it won’t take me long
to discover it. At least, she is thoughtful enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
to invite me to the reception. Your wonderful Miss
Dean hasn’t invited you.”
</p>
<p>
Calista merely laughed. “You large-sized infant,
give her time. You happen to be the first person
I’ve heard of thus far, with an invitation.”
</p>
<p>
The next evening Calista announced, a triumphant
twinkle in her shrewd black eyes, that Miss
Dean had invited her to the frolic.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Macy has invited Charlotte. We have all
been asked to go to Miss Dean’s room this evening
for a spread. She and her crowd want to meet the
rest of you girls and invite you to the dance. Miss
Dean says Miss Harper was going to invite you,
Gus. Now you see what you’ve missed by accepting
that horrid Miss Walbert’s invitation. Miss
Harper is a power here at Hamilton. She’s considered
the most original girl who ever attended this
college.”
</p>
<p>
“Mercy!” was Gussie’s sarcastic reception of this
piece of information. “Don’t worry about me. I’m
satisfied. I sha’n’t go near Miss Dean’s room.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, suit yourself,” Calista replied in a
tired voice. “I am all through bothering my head
about you, Gus. Have things your own way and
see trouble in the long run. I’ll make your apologies
to Miss Dean and Miss Harper, then I’m
done.”
</p>
<p>
“Apologies, nothing,” scoffed Gussie. “Tell ’em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
<em>I said they made me tired</em>, and to keep a hundred
miles away from me.”
</p>
<p>
Secretly she was regretful of the fact that she
had too quickly accepted an invitation from a student
for whom she cherished no special preference.
In her heart she did not like Elizabeth Walbert, but
she had not yet become clearly conscious of this.
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth, on the other hand, had invited Augusta
merely to serve her own ends. A cutting remark on
Gussie’s part during their first acquaintance concerning
the Lookouts had resolved Elizabeth to
cultivate the disgruntled freshman’s society. Possessed
of a reckless spirit, Gussie would be just the
one to help in any scheme she might plan against
the girls she detested.
</p>
<p>
As neither had the remotest conception of the
other’s true character, they were both due to take
part in a summary awakening. On the evening of
the hop, Elizabeth lingered at the Lotus with two
juniors until after seven o’clock. In consequence
Gussie’s chums had gone on to the gymnasium with
their escorts an hour before Elizabeth knocked on
Gussie’s door. Always impatient of delay, Augusta
was growing momentarily more incensed as
time slid by and she remained waiting and neglected.
Her reception of the junior was sulky
rather than affable.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at the frolic too late for the grand march
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
and minus the usual corsage bouquet of flowers
which Elizabeth had forgotten to order sent to
Augusta, the tall freshman felt distinctly aggrieved.
Not one of her chums were without violets or orchids,
generously provided by their escorts.
</p>
<p>
Courtesy, which had not been shown her, she reflected
sullenly, pleaded with her not to flash forth
her frank opinion to her escort of these lapses.
Gussie, however, was at the boiling point and ready
to bubble over at a word.
</p>
<p>
The climax to Augusta’s displeasure was reached
when after two dances with her, Elizabeth deserted
her for the society of Alida Burton and Lola Elster.
While neither of the latter students liked Elizabeth,
both were anxious to find out whether she had seen
and talked with Leslie Cairns.
</p>
<p>
“There’s Walbert across the room,” Lola had remarked
in an undertone to Alida. “Let’s find out
what she knows about Les. We can jolly her along
for awhile and then shake her. She’s always crazy
to have us notice her. You pump her; and then I
will. Be careful what you say to her. Get all she
knows, but don’t give up any information about
anyone or anything.”
</p>
<p>
Shortly after ten o’clock Gussie disappeared from
the scene of revelry. She was so angry she felt as
though her brown eyes must emit sparks. On account
of her spleen against their escorts she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
foolishly declined to go near her chums. She was
sore at heart and jealous of the new friendships
they had formed. Chiefly, her ire was directed
against Elizabeth.
</p>
<p>
“Just wait until I have a good chance to tell <em>her</em>
a few things,” she wrathfully ruminated as she
scudded across the campus in the moonless darkness.
“I wouldn’t have neglected a rag doll the
way she slighted me!”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Gus?” Charlotte inquired of Flossie
Hart late that evening. Flossie had amiably gone
to Marjorie’s spread and there buried the hatchet.
“I haven’t seen her for over an hour. I’m afraid
she isn’t having a good time. I haven’t seen her
dancing much. I asked her to dance, but she turned
up her nose and said, ‘Go dance with your seniors.’”
</p>
<p>
Charlotte laughed. “I hope she <em>hasn’t</em> had a good
time. It will teach her to keep away from that Miss
Walbert. Every time I’ve seen Miss Walbert tonight
she has been with those two seniors, Miss Burton
and—I can’t remember the other’s name. She’s
small and dark and wears awfully flashy, mannish-looking
suits. You know the one I mean.”
</p>
<p>
Flossie nodded. “Too bad Gus wouldn’t be agreeable,”
she said wistfully. “I have had a fine time
tonight. She might have, too. It’s her own fault
if she hasn’t.”
</p>
<p>
After the frolic the eight Travelers residing at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
Wayland Hall stopped in Ronny’s room for a chat
before retiring.
</p>
<p>
“Will you have tea, chocolate,—what will you
have?” hospitably inquired Ronny. “You can’t
have lemonade at this hour of the night. Besides, I
have no lemons.”
</p>
<p>
“Whoever heard of lemonade without lemons?”
derided Muriel.
</p>
<p>
“No one. I merely said you couldn’t have it,
etc.,” Ronny sweetly asserted.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care for either eats or drinks,” declined
Jerry. “I am just hanging around in here for a
few minutes to hear what I can hear.”
</p>
<p>
“Same with me. It is comfy and sociable to
compare notes after a jollification, even if one is
sleepy.” Marjorie beamed drowsily on her chums.
“Girls,” she sat up suddenly, “what has become of
Miss Forbes? I didn’t see her after ten o’clock. I
sent half a dozen girls over to ask her to dance. I
thought Miss Walbert neglected her. She had no
flowers, either.”
</p>
<p>
“I noticed that. Poor <em>infant terrible</em>!” Ronny
smiled.
</p>
<p>
“I sent Martha and Ethel Laird to make her acquaintance,”
Leila said. “Even though she would
have none of me, I remembered my fine old Irish
manners.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a credit to old Ireland, Hamilton, or any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
other spot you happen to set your distinguished
Irish foot upon,” Marjorie laughingly assured.
</p>
<p>
“I am that,” Leila blandly agreed. “I prefer myself
any day to Miss Walbert.”
</p>
<p>
Gussie Forbes had too late arrived at the same
opinion. The dance over, Florence Hart had found
her curled up in an arm chair fast asleep. She had
not removed her party gown and a suspicious pinkness
about her eyelids suggested tears. Awakened,
she was not tearful at all. She launched forth in a
bitter tirade against her discourteous escort.
</p>
<p>
“You wait, Floss,” she said, her eyes flashing.
“I won’t forget this evening, in a hurry! Some day
before the year’s over, Miss Smarty Walbert will
understand that I <em>haven’t</em> forgotten it. First time
I meet her I shall tell her what I think of her.
That won’t be the end of it. Later, I’ll pay her up
for this evening! See if I don’t!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>CHAPTER XI—A PATCHED-UP FRIENDSHIP</h2>
<p>
“A guilty conscience need no accuser.” Elizabeth
Walbert was well aware that she had been
guilty of great discourtesy to Augusta Forbes. She
had no intention of admitting it, though. Meeting
Augusta in the lavatory the following morning, she
fixed her large blue eyes on the freshman in simulated
reproach.
</p>
<p>
“Where did you go to last night?” she coolly inquired.
“Just before the hop ended I hunted all
over for you.”
</p>
<p>
Augusta turned a stony face toward her. “Did
you, indeed? You amaze me,” she said with biting
sarcasm. “So you took that much trouble? <em>Sorry!</em>
Since you did not concern yourself about me earlier
in the evening, it doesn’t matter whether or not you
know where I went.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Augusta!” exclaimed Elizabeth with a
rising inflection. “What on earth is——”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Forbes, if you please,” cut in Gussie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
sharply. “I wish you to know that I think you the
rudest, most discourteous person in the whole world.
You slighted me last night and I resented it. I
resent it still. I was invited to the frolic by a really
fine girl; I am sorry she did not invite me first. All
my chums had a splendid time. Thanks to you, I
didn’t. <em>They</em> did not wish me to accept your invitation,
for they don’t approve of you. I stood up
for you and accepted. Of course, then, I did not go
near them. I depended on you to introduce me to
other girls, and you paid hardly any attention to me
after we were inside the gym. You——”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be so silly,” pettishly interrupted Elizabeth.
“I——”
</p>
<p>
“Truth is never silly,” Gussie flashed back. She
had said her say in low enough tones so that they
were attracting no attention from the two girls at
the other end of the lavatory. “Now forget that
you ever spoke to me. I’ve forgotten already that
I ever met you. Good morning.”
</p>
<p>
Gussie marched out of the lavatory, head held
high, leaving Elizabeth red-faced and angry. This
was the beginning of war between the two. Not
since Leslie Cairns had scored her for her treachery
that day on the campus had Elizabeth been thus arraigned.
She spitefully resolved to make Gussie a
mark for ridicule at Hamilton. She could do it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
Was she not a junior? As for Augusta, she was
nothing but a big, stupid freshie!
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth had awakened that morning quite out
of sorts. Her eagerness to cling to Alida and Lola
at the frolic had lost her much of the evening’s
pleasure. The two seniors had declared the frolic
“an awful bore.” They had danced but little, preferring
to sit back and criticize. Though they had
called her to join them early in the evening and had
been more friendly than for a long time, toward the
close of the frolic they simply drifted away from
her. So cleverly did they manage she was not aware
until afterward that they had deliberately dropped
her. It hurt her vanity, but not her feelings.
</p>
<p>
To discover that Gussie had decamped did not add
to her peace of mind. She determined not to attend
any more college entertainments. They were stupid
and silly. Anything Elizabeth disapproved usually
went under this ban. Her head aching from a repast
of two chocolate eclairs and a nougat bar, eaten after
she came from the frolic, Elizabeth decided to cut
her classes that day. She would take two headache
powders, sleep until noon, and go for a long ride in
the afternoon. All this she planned after her tilt
with Augusta.
</p>
<p>
Shortly before two o’clock that afternoon she
went to the garage for her car and was soon speeding
toward the town of Hamilton. Her object was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
a trip to Breton Hill, a village twenty miles south
of Hamilton. First she planned to stop in Hamilton
and eat a light luncheon.
</p>
<p>
Wavering between the Lotus and the Ivy, she
finally went to the Ivy. Twenty minutes after she
entered the tea shop, a girl drove by in a roadster.
Her glance resting on a familiar blue and buff car,
she smiled sourly, drove on for perhaps a block, then
came back and parked her roadster in front of the
Ivy. Leaving her car in slow, deliberate fashion,
she sauntered up the wide stone walk and into the
shop. One swift survey of the room showed her
Elizabeth Walbert at a side table. She stood for a
moment, her eyes narrowing, then walked boldly to
where Elizabeth sat and took the vacant chair opposite
her.
</p>
<p>
The latter looked up from her plate and encountered
Leslie Cairns’ eyes. Elizabeth was genuinely
surprised. Leslie pretended to be.
</p>
<p>
“Where—why Leslie Cairns!” stammered the
unsuspecting junior.
</p>
<p>
“This <em>is</em> a surprise, Miss Walbert!” Leslie returned
in not quite friendly tones.
</p>
<p>
“I see you are angry with me still, Leslie,” she
said plaintively. “You blamed me for saying a lot
of things I never said. I heard Dulcie was the cause
of your—er—trouble last year. She wrote me after
she left Hamilton. I didn’t answer her letter.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, forget it.” Leslie made an indifferent gesture.
“What’s done can’t be undone. You were
wise not to write to Dulcie. She was the most
treacherous little reptile I ever knew. How’s college?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, so, so. I am at Wayland Hall now. It is
full of freshies. Miss Harper and Miss Mason are
there again. So are Miss Merrick and Miss Trent.
Four P. G’s at Wayland.”
</p>
<p>
“Four N. G’s, you mean,” corrected Leslie bitterly.
“I heard they were back. I met Lola and
Alida not long ago.”
</p>
<p>
“You <em>did</em>? They never said a word about it to
me. I was with them a long time last night, too.
The sophs gave their dance last night. Hateful
things! They might have told me. I think Lola is
<em>so</em> selfish!” Elizabeth pouted her displeasure.
</p>
<p>
“Selfish! You are right about that. She is.”
Leslie spoke with sudden energy. “She winds
Alida around her finger.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course.” Elizabeth leaned forward, her interest
rising. It was good to see Leslie again.
Leslie never cared what she said about others.
</p>
<p>
The waitress approaching, Leslie ordered a
luncheon which she did not want, then turned her
attention to her companion again.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me the college news; everything you can
think of,” she commanded. “I’m visiting an aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
in town. Don’t know just how long I shall be here.
That’s all there is to tell about me. But <em>you</em> must
really have news.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there isn’t much going on, as yet. I’ll tell
you about the frolic first.” Elizabeth recounted the
affair from her viewpoint. From that she went from
one bit of campus gossip to another.
</p>
<p>
Leslie listened, careful not to interrupt. She was
tactfully pursuing a certain course.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know anything about this students’ beneficiary
business that Bean and her beanstalks organized
last year, Bess?” she finally asked with a careless
air. “I heard Lola mention it the day I saw
her. I didn’t care to ask her about it. Last year,
just before the Sans were fired from Hamilton, I
heard the organizers were going to take up a collection
among themselves to create a scholarship fund
or something like that. I thought I might like to
contribute, if I knew just what it was all about.
I’d do it anonymously. I wouldn’t for worlds let
anyone but you know. Do you think you could find
out all about it for me?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” was the ready promise. Re-established
thus easily in Leslie’s favor, Elizabeth was
feeling elated. To be entrusted with this commission
meant she would see Leslie often. Loyal to
no one, she had liked Leslie better than the majority
of girls she had known.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know a freshie at Acasia House who is quite
friendly with Miss Laird. Bean, as you call her, is
a great friend of Miss Laird’s. I think this freshman
could get the information from Miss Laird.
She is clever.”
</p>
<p>
“Ask her then, and I will appreciate it and do
something for you in return. Above all, Bess, don’t
mention this to a soul. If you do, I’ll know it. In
spite of the way I was treated I have a wish to do
something for old Hamilton.” Leslie put on a becomingly
serious expression.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t tell,” promised the other girl. “It is fine
in you to feel so about Hamilton. I should call it
true nobility of spirit. You weren’t understood in
college, Leslie.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I wasn’t.” Leslie sighed her make-believe
regret. She had begun to enjoy the part she was
now playing.
</p>
<p>
The two did not leave the tea room for over an
hour after meeting. When they emerged to the
street each was satisfied with what she had gained
from the other. They had agreed to meet the next
Wednesday at four o’clock at the Ivy.
</p>
<p>
“How are you getting along as a driver?” Leslie
asked, not without a smile as she sighted Elizabeth’s
brightly painted car. It was reminiscent of last
year’s disasters.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very well. I’ve always told you that I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
keep the road if people would keep out of my way.
Every near accident I’ve ever had has been the fault
of someone else’s poor driving.”
</p>
<p>
To this airy, self-exonerative statement Leslie
made no response save by a twist of her loose-lipped
mouth. She was very near derisive laughter. Elizabeth,
blandly complacent, did not notice her companion’s
peculiar expression.
</p>
<p>
“Let me give you one piece of advice, Bess,” she
said brusquely. “Get through with that giddy blue
and tan car of yours. It is a dead give-away. One
can recognize it a mile away. You think you are
O. K. as a driver. You’re not. Don’t deceive yourself.
You can’t put it over me. I know your style
of driving and it’s punk. Why don’t you learn to
drive?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know,” Elizabeth bridled. “I like
my car blue. Blue is my color.” She ignored Leslie’s
fling at her driving abilities.
</p>
<p>
“It will be your finish some day; on that car, I
mean. Get a black car. You need a new one. This
one is passé. You could have it painted black, but
what’s the use? Trade this one in on a new
machine. Maybe you’ll do better driving a new
car.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you are right. I think my father will
let me have a new machine.” Possession of a brand
new car appealed to vain Elizabeth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
“I <em>know</em> I’m right. Suppose you were to have
trouble along the pike as you had with that driver
last year. If anyone reported you the tag that gave
you away would be: ‘The student I mean was driving
a blue and buff car.’” Leslie imitated to perfection
a high, complaining voice. “With a black
car you could simply scud away from trouble and
no one would remember how you looked. What?”
</p>
<p>
“You are right, Leslie,” Elizabeth reluctantly
conceded. “I never before looked at the matter in
that light.”
</p>
<p>
Leslie was tempted to reply, “That was because
you were too stupidly vain of your gay, blue ice
wagon.” She refrained. Discretion warned her to
allow matters to rest as they were. She had no
desire to arouse resentment in the shallow, but
tricky, junior. Her advice concerning a change of
cars was sound and she knew it. While Leslie had
neither liking nor faith in Elizabeth Walbert, she
needed her services. She thought she had learned
by past bitter experience precisely how to manage
Elizabeth.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>CHAPTER XII—FULL-FLEDGED PROMOTERS</h2>
<p>
“The very first thing to do, Robin, is to find out
whether those properties used for boarding houses
are for sale. There is no use in hoping for one little
instant that Miss Susanna will ever relent enough
to allow us ground on the campus for any new
houses.” Marjorie spoke with finality.
</p>
<p>
“Queer, isn’t it? Hamilton doesn’t even own
itself.” A flickering smile touched Robin’s lips.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Susanna doesn’t consider that she owns the
college,” Marjorie explained in defense of her
eccentric friend. “Miss Humphrey said Mr. Brooke
Hamilton’s will stipulated that she must sanction
all building, improvements or important changes on
the campus. The college has free right to choose
everything else.”
</p>
<p>
Not even to Robin Page, her dearest Hamilton
friend, outside Wayland Hall, had Marjorie ever
divulged the fact of her friendship with the last of
the Hamiltons. She would have liked to tell Robin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
that, only a week previous, she had taken tea with
Miss Susanna and heard again the old lady’s repeated
statement that never should Hamilton College
receive even the ghost of a favor from her.
</p>
<p>
“I wish we knew Miss Susanna Hamilton,” sighed
Robin. “We could then have it out with her on
the subject at least.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie, feeling like a criminal, said nothing for
a little. The two seniors had just come from a walk
past the boarding houses, the site of which they
hoped to be able to use for the building of the dormitory
of their generous dreams.
</p>
<p>
“About these boarding houses, Robin,” Marjorie
began afresh, desirous of leading her friend away
from the subject of Miss Susanna. “Anna Towne’s
landlady told her that they were in the hands of a
real estate agent in the town of Hamilton. His
name is Mr. Charles Cutler and his office is on
Keene Street. He is the person we must see.”
</p>
<p>
“Since the girls off the campus wouldn’t accept
our offer, we have six thousand, two hundred and
ten dollars in our treasury,” announced Robin.
“We must keep some of that for our regular beneficiary
fund; say two thousand dollars. That gives
us a little more than four thousand to pay down on
the property.”
</p>
<p>
“It is only a drop in the bucket,” Marjorie said
doubtfully. “I suppose those properties, all together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
are worth thirty or forty thousand to the
owner. The question of the money is easily solved.
Ronny will finance the undertaking for us. She is
determined to do it. She would give us the money,
but I won’t accept it. I think the Hamilton girls
now and to come should take this debt upon themselves
and earn the money to pay it by their own
efforts.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” nodded Robin. “Think what a good
time we had getting up the revue. It was splendid
practice for us in many ways. Let the girls who
come after us have something to plan and work for.
It will be the best thing that can happen to them.
Besides, giving plays and entertainments helps to
create the right kind of social atmosphere and also
brings to light the talents of the students. I am for
being independent and earning every cent of this
money.”
</p>
<p>
“It will keep the Nineteen Travelers busy this
year and we’ll choose nineteen more to replace us,”
Marjorie declared with quiet satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
The Nineteen Travelers were now a surety. Marjorie
had carried out her spoken resolve to Jerry to
call together those students outside Wayland Hall
who had been closest to the Nine Travelers. The
original Nine Travelers had all expressed a desire
to enlarge the informal society. It had therefore
been regularly organized as a sorority one evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
in Leila’s and Vera’s room. The new sorority was
now planning to do great things during their senior
year at Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
“Self-denial last year didn’t hurt any of us,”
Robin gaily pointed out. “I saved three hundred
and two dollars. The other girls saved anywhere
from two to three hundred apiece. Think what it
means to our treasury now!”
</p>
<p>
“I saved three hundred and seven dollars. I
didn’t miss it. I haven’t a new suit this fall, and I
don’t want one. I brought back only two new
frocks. Both of them were presents to me from my
father. I won’t give up going to Baretti’s. That
is my one luxury. I shall save as much as I can
this year, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t it be fine if we could make and save
enough money this year to clear the purchase price
of these properties?” Robin’s eyes sparkled at the
thought.
</p>
<p>
“We couldn’t unless something positively miraculous
came our way.” Marjorie shook her head. “It
would take all our spare time and more too. True,
we don’t have basket ball to think of now, but on
the other hand our subjects are harder. I wish I
were as brilliant as Lucy. She had enough credits
to be graduated last June, but she needed another
year in biology and physics. This year she will
have those two subjects and Political Science. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
will leave her quite a good deal of time for her own.
What do you suppose she intends to do with it?”
</p>
<p>
“Tell me, for I am a no-good guesser.”
</p>
<p>
“She is going to be President Matthews’ regular
secretary. She talked it over with him one day last
week. He made arrangements so that his work
would not interfere with her classes. That was
really a concession, but he told her he had hoped
from the first day she worked for him finally to
have her for his secretary. She is so pleased. Her
salary is thirty-five dollars a week. We were all
glad for her sake,” Marjorie ended with generous
enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
Robin expressed equal pleasure in Lucy’s rise in
fortune. “It is just one more example of how beautifully
everything seems to be working out for us
all at Hamilton,” she said happily. “During our
freshman year our lot was full of snags. One by
one they have dropped away. Long before the Sans
left college snobbishness was on the wane.”
</p>
<p>
“Phil and Barbara deserve credit for much of
that. I never saw a girl fight harder for democracy
than Phil did during her freshie year. She really
turned her class inside out and made them over.”
Marjorie’s admiration for staunch, independent
Phyllis Moore had steadily grown with time.
</p>
<p>
“I hear Miss Walbert is at Wayland Hall.” Mention
of Phil’s energetic stand during her freshman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
year brought her unworthy opponent to Robin’s
thoughts. “Is she as hateful as ever? I never
could endure her, and you know, Marvelous Manager,
I am fairly good-natured. Phil had an awful
time over the way she tried to run the freshies.”
</p>
<p>
“Your disposition couldn’t be improved upon,”
laughed Marjorie. “Yes, she is at the Hall. I seldom
see her except at a distance. She isn’t there
much to meals.”
</p>
<p>
“She has a new car; a limousine. It is black,
this time. I have seen her driving it or rather
driving ‘at it.’ Someone, I forgot who, said Leslie
Cairns was visiting an aunt in Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie showed no surprise. She had already
heard of Leslie’s re-appearance. Robin did not continue
on the subject of Leslie. Her observation had
been impersonal. Shortly afterward she left Robin,
the two having agreed to call at the real estate
agent’s office on Wednesday of the coming week.
</p>
<p>
Recounting to Jerry the talk between Robin and
herself, Jerry asked abruptly: “Have you girls told
anyone you were going to try to get hold of those
properties? That is, anyone outside our own
crowd?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t say it has been kept a secret,” Marjorie
returned. “At the time of the show we gave last
winter, some of the girls who helped a good deal,
like Ethel Laird and Grace Dearborn, may have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
mentioned it. For instance, Grace sold tickets all
over the campus. We were talking at that time
about how fine it would be to be able to found a
dormitory. Nothing has been said of late outside
our crowd, that I recall. Robin and I have only
started the ball rolling again. Why did you ask,
Jeremiah?”
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking. If the real estate agent happened
to hear you wanted the properties he might
raise the price of them to more than they were
worth. You don’t care to be stung, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly <em>not</em>. The less we have to pay for the
site the more money we shall have to put into the
building. Besides, we don’t care to be saddled with
any larger debt than we can help. We are going to
see him next Wednesday. The chances are he won’t
have heard anything about it in that short space of
time—unless he heard last spring.” Marjorie
frowned brief anxiety. Then her face cleared.
“Oh, it isn’t at all likely,” she said. “Robin and I
are going to put every minute we can spare into the
work. Thank goodness, we studied hard enough
our first three years! We are sure of getting
through this year without having to dig.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve had loads of good times, but still we have
kept up in all our subjects,” commented Jerry with
pardonable pride. “Now, in my sage and profound
seniorship I propose to turn philanthropist and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
promoter with you, Marvelous Manager. By the
way, I brought up your mail. It’s over there.”
Jerry indicated a small pile of letters on the top of
a two-shelved wall book-case.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you.” Marjorie made a dive for them.
“Six; I am lucky today!” She hastily sat down in
the nearest chair to enjoy them. Reading each as
she opened it, she was slow in coming to the last
one of the pile.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a note from Professor Leonard!” she exclaimed,
mystification written on her pretty features.
“He asks me to come to the gymnasium at four-thirty
tomorrow afternoon. He doesn’t say anything
in the note but that.”
</p>
<p>
“Basket ball, of course,” guessed Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“But I didn’t play on the team last year and he
knows it. Oh, I think I know. Maybe he would
like me to umpire or referee a game. No, it can’t
be that, for he dropped basket ball after the Sans
made so much trouble. I am sure I can’t guess why
he wants to see me.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll know after you’ve seen him,” returned
Jerry, snickering.
</p>
<p>
“I have an idea I shall,” retorted Marjorie.
“That was a brilliant remark, Jeremiah.”
</p>
<p>
When at four-thirty on the following afternoon
Marjorie sought the physical culture director in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
gymnasium, she was somewhat taken aback by the
concise request: “I would like to make you chairman
of the senior sports committee, Miss Dean. I
have been urged to resume charge of college sports
by President Matthews. You may recall <em>why</em> I
refused to act as the director of them two years ago.
Well, things have changed here since then. A certain
pernicious element has been removed. I am
going to try again, simply to please the doctor.
Will you help me? I have in mind for that committee,
you as chairman, Miss Page, Miss Harding
and Miss Hunter. The four of you can arrange a
series of basket ball games. In the spring we will
have tennis. Miss Hunter is an expert player. I
want her chiefly on account of her tennis prowess.
It will not take up much of your time. You would
probably attend the games held here, at any rate.
Think it over and let me know by tomorrow. I
wish to make a start as soon as possible.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie listened to the director in silent consternation.
She did not wish to serve on any such
committee. It would interfere, to some extent, in
her new plans. On the other hand, she wished very
much to help Professor Leonard. He had made a
concession in again resuming directorship of college
sports. Could she do less than aid him? She
aspired to serve her Alma Mater in the best way.
Perhaps this work was as important as building a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
dormitory. Professor Leonard had said, “Think it
over.” Marjorie had already decided.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t wait until tomorrow, Professor Leonard,
to decide. I will accept the honor now. If
you wish, I will see the other girls. I think you
can count on them.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Miss Dean. I was sure you wouldn’t
fail me.” The professor’s hand went out impulsively.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie reflected with a twinge of remorse as
she returned the handshake that she had come very
near to failing him.
</p>
<p>
“You will help me greatly by seeing your friends.
I wish you four would meet me here day after tomorrow
at this time. We will then discuss our
plans for the season.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll simply have to make room for committee
duties on my programme somehow,” she thought,
as she left the gymnasium and cut across the
campus, headed for Silverton Hall. “Robin is in
as deeply as I. Still, I know she wouldn’t have refused,
under the same circumstances. If I had
dreamed, ever since my freshman year, of such an
honor, I’d never have attained it. Just because I
have about twice as much on hand as I can look
after, along comes something else. It’s what I
should call an embarrassment of riches.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>CHAPTER XIII—ON THE CREST OF HOPE</h2>
<p>
While Marjorie was sighing a little over the
multiplicity of responsibilities which had fallen to
her lot, Elizabeth Walbert was also a person with
several irons in the fire. She had promised Leslie
Cairns that she would glean valuable information
concerning the students’ beneficiary fund. She had
sworn to be even with Augusta Forbes. She had
determined to keep in favor with Alida Burton and
Lola Elster.
</p>
<p>
Leslie being by far the most important person on
her horizon, Elizabeth strained a point to gather
the information Leslie desired. The day after her
talk with the ex-student she set out for Acasia
House the moment classes were over for the day.
Marian Foster, the freshman she had mentioned,
was not unlike Elizabeth in disposition. She was
an arrant social climber and ranked money and lavish
expenditure of it above everything. Introduced
to Elizabeth on the campus, by another freshman,
she had treated the junior with marked respect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
This had pleased Elizabeth, who had grown more
unpopular at Hamilton with each year she returned.
She had promptly singled out Marian as an object
of her patronizing attentions. These had consisted
in a luncheon or two. several drives and one dinner
at the Colonial.
</p>
<p>
Ethel Laird, in her sweet, gracious fashion, had
also been kind to Marian, who had been very lonely
on first arrival at Acasia House. Thus she stood
between two influences. She had been shrewd
enough to hide her true character from Ethel,
whose popularity as a senior she had quickly discovered.
Privately she decided to play two parts. To
Ethel she would be merely the friendly, appreciative
freshie. It was Elizabeth’s favor she really
desired.
</p>
<p>
On this particular afternoon she welcomed Elizabeth
with delight. She was even more pleased
when the latter proposed a ride and a dinner at the
Lotus. The invitation, which she quickly accepted,
put her in a beatific state of mind which bred confidence.
She was therefore very willing, as the new
car, not the blue and buff “ice wagon,” bowled along
the wide highway, to chatter of affairs at Acasia
House. Long before the ride was over and the
two girls anchored at the Lotus, Elizabeth had
heard that which brought a triumphant light to her
insincere blue eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you say you heard this yourself?” Elizabeth
suavely questioned. “You are sure that is true
about that dormitory rumor? So many stories start
on the campus that aren’t true at all. A girl will
start what she calls a ‘blind alley’ sometimes, just
to tease the freshies. They will grow awfully excited
over it. Then the laugh is on them.”
</p>
<p>
“This wasn’t a rumor,” protested Marian. “It
was gospel truth. I was in Miss Laird’s room
when these two seniors came to see her. I wouldn’t
have stayed after they came, but she seemed to wish
me to. They asked her to attend a meeting at Wayland
Hall. Then they talked about hoping they
could buy this property where the boarding houses
stand. It was so interesting to hear them. Miss
Dean is beautiful, isn’t she? Miss Page is awfully
cute, too.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know either of them,” evaded Elizabeth.
“I have heard they were clever in a diggy way.
Do tell me more of what they said. I am interested
in this dormitory idea. I shall contribute five hundred
dollars at least, maybe more, to help build it.
It won’t mean that much to me.” She snapped her
fingers grandly. She flattered herself into believing
that Leslie could not have acted more cleverly.
</p>
<p>
As Marian was limited to twenty-five dollars a
month spending money, Elizabeth’s affluence impressed
her deeply. She outdid herself in trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
please the crafty junior. Nor could she guess that
her every word was being stored up in Elizabeth’s
mind. Later, in the privacy of the junior’s room,
it would be transferred to paper. She would not be
able to see Leslie for two or three days, so she
resorted to notes, fearful lest she might forget a
part of what she had heard.
</p>
<p>
On the same Wednesday on which Marjorie and
Robin called at the office of Charles Cutler, the real
estate agent, Elizabeth met Leslie Cairns at the
Lotus. Neither pair crossed each other’s paths.
The information Elizabeth gave Leslie caused her
to laugh often in her silent hob-goblin fashion.
Elizabeth marked this with a little uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
“Why does what I am telling you strike you as
so funny, Leslie?” she inquired suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“Because it does,” was Leslie’s cool response.
“I can just imagine those infants taking a job like
that boarding house proposition on their shoulders.
I am willing to contribute to it, but I am afraid
they will fall down on it. That’s all.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie and Robin, however, were floating on
the top wave of hope as they talked with the agent,
a tall, spare man with honest blue eyes and gentle
manners.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know what the owner of these properties
wants for them,” he said. “Five years ago he
offered them for twenty-eight thousand dollars.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
There are seven houses in the block which you
girls wish to buy. That was at the rate of four
thousand apiece. Real estate has increased in value
since then, but not much in this section. He might
ask thirty-five thousand, but not more than that.
You could sell the houses for old lumber. They
would have to be torn down. That would net you
something. It would be a relief to see the last of
them. I always thought that whole row so unsightly
in contrast to the beauty of the campus.
Pity the others will have to stand. If you will call
one week from today I can let you know the owner’s
price. I expect him here within a few days.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that great news?” exulted Robin, when
they had left the office. “Thirty-five thousand is
five thousand less than we figured. But, oh, my
goodness, what a job we have undertaken! If we
buy those properties, not a thing can be done about
tearing them down until college closes. The off-the-campus
girls must have a place to live. Then
there’s next fall to think of. The dormitory
wouldn’t be built so soon. It will take all summer
to tear down the houses.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Sufficient unto the day’,” quoted Marjorie optimistically.
“We will have to solve all those problems
as we come to them. We could arrange for
places for such students as couldn’t find accommodations
in the campus houses to live in the town of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
Hamilton. We would have to make arrangements
then with the jitney men to carry them back and
forth, morning and night. There would have to be
a luncheon provided for them near the campus.
Signor Baretti might do that at a special price.
This is only tentative. Still it shows that where
there’s a will there’s a way.”
</p>
<p>
“You deserve your name of Marvelous Manager.
Jerry made no mistake when she gave it to you,”
declared Robin admiringly. “Honestly, Marjorie,
I can’t tell you when I have felt so happy! It is so
wonderful, this plan of ours! I was half afraid
that Mr. Cutler would say, first thing, ‘No, the
owner doesn’t care to sell.’ Now we are fairly sure
of getting what we want. The minute we hear we
can have it, I am going to give a party in my room
to the Nineteen Travelers. A year ago I would
have given it at Baretti’s. Not now. I have to
practice economy. I’m a promoter of large enterprises.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>CHAPTER XIV—WARY FISH</h2>
<p>
Following on the heels of exultation, however,
came disappointment. On the day before that set
for their call at Mr. Cutler’s office, Marjorie received
a line from him stating that the owner of
the properties was in Chicago and would not return
until after Thanksgiving. Immediately he returned,
she would be apprised of the fact.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no use in being disappointed about it,”
she said bravely to Jerry. “We have the first chance
to buy the properties. I shall not think much about
it until nearer the time. The freshies are going to
play their first game against the sophs one week
from Saturday. I may as well turn my attention
to my committee duties. Ahem!”
</p>
<p>
“You are a person of some importance, aren’t
you?” Jerry struck an attitude before Marjorie of
mock respect. “Who’s going to win, freshies or
sophs?”
</p>
<p>
“Freshies, I believe. <em>L’enfant terrible</em> is a fine
player. She is so clever. For a girl of her height
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
and weight she moves like lightning. One might
think she was rough to watch her. She isn’t. She
plays a close game, but a clean one. Those two
freshmen who go around with Miss Walbert are
good players, too. I am glad Miss Forbes was
picked for center. She is a fine girl, Jerry, even
though she doesn’t like me,” Marjorie praised with
a tolerant smile.
</p>
<p>
“She is not so worse,” Jerry reluctantly conceded.
“I don’t mind her turning up her already
turned-up nose at me. I am not stuck on myself. I
object to her not appreciating you.”
</p>
<p>
“So long as I have the fond regard of Jeremiah
I can stand a few cold breezes.” Marjorie reached
across the width of the table and administered a
fond pat to Jerry’s plump hand.
</p>
<p>
“There’s worse’n me, lady,” croaked Jerry in her
tramp voice, which made them both laugh.
</p>
<p>
It having been decided by the Nineteen Travelers
not to undertake the giving of an entertainment
until after Thanksgiving, Marjorie had a fair
amount of time to give to basket ball. Professor
Leonard had asked her and her three assistants on
committee to drop in at the gymnasium occasionally
during practice. “It will give you a line on
the teams. I am anxious for fair play and no
favors. I want the morale of these teams kept up.
I recall a time when it was sadly lacking.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
The instructor was brutally candid in referring
to the underhanded methods of the departed Sans.
He would never get over his utter loathing for
their lack of principle.
</p>
<p>
As for Augusta Forbes, energetic center on her
team, her unreasoning dislike for Marjorie and
Jerry had not abated. She was greatly displeased
to find Marjorie at the head of the sports committee.
She talked loudly in the privacy of her room
about not expecting a square deal from the “wonderful”
committee. She attributed her position on
the freshman team entirely to Professor Leonard’s
superior judgment. As a matter of fact, the committee
had had the deciding word. Contrary to
usual custom, the players received notices of their
election to the teams the following day instead of
on the floor. This gave the director and his committee
an opportunity to talk matters over before
deciding.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the rest of her Bertram chums, Gussie
had put in a more or less stormy fall on the campus.
She was not specially tactful and often gave unnecessary
offense. She had a habit of blurting out the
truth regardless of whose feelings might suffer.
Yet she was quick to praise when something pleased
her, and generous to a fault.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, she had made the one mistake of
briefly cultivating Elizabeth Walbert. The after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
effects of that mistake still lingered to disturb her
peace of mind. In keeping with her spiteful resolve,
Elizabeth had not lost an opportunity to ridicule
or annoy Gussie. Her influence among the half
dozen freshmen at the Hall with whom she consorted
was great enough to incite them to mischief
against tall, babyish Gussie.
</p>
<p>
One evening she returned from dinner to find all
her framed pictures turned toward the wall, her bed
dismantled, the sheets and covers tied in hard knots,
her text books lodged in the wastebasket. Another
rainy evening she returned from the dining room to
open windows. The rain was beating in the room
and no amount of pressure would close them.
Wrathful examination discovered nails as the opposing
force—cleverly driven in the sashes so as almost
to escape notice. On still another occasion, she was
decidedly startled to come upon a masked, black-garbed
figure stretched on her couch bed. It turned
out to be a dummy made of her clothing and attired
in an old black domino; one of the very dominos
worn by the Sans on the night they had hazed Marjorie.
Elizabeth Walbert had found it tucked away
on a top closet shelf of her room, where it had
escaped the notice of the maid during the summer
house cleaning.
</p>
<p>
Such practical jokes, to Elizabeth’s mind,
amounted to nothing. She yearned to do something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
really malicious. Ridicule of Gussie appeared to do
her little damage. What the “baby elephant”
needed was a good scare. With this in mind, she
sought the help of Lola Elster and Alida Burton.
Gussie had scoffed openly at Lola’s mannish attire
and bold manner. She had been treated by both
seniors with a haughty disdain which she deeply
resented. Therefore she had not hesitated to express
to other freshmen a frankly unflattering opinion
of Lola and Alida. During her brief stretch
of friendship with Elizabeth, Gussie had repeated it
to the junior.
</p>
<p>
It was on a rainy evening in late October that
Elizabeth laid her grievance before the two seniors.
She had hardly stepped over their threshold when
she burst forth with: “I came to have a talk with
you about that horrid Miss Forbes. I won’t endure
any more insults from her. Will you two help me
teach her a lesson?”
</p>
<p>
“How?” inquired Alida, laying down her text
book and staring interestedly.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I must think out. She has said
rude, cutting things about all of us. This afternoon
I met her and a gang of girls coming across the
campus. The minute she spied me she said something
to the rest of them. The whole crowd turned
and walked away around me; just as though they
couldn’t bear to come near me, even in passing. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
felt <em>so</em> humiliated. That is only a very small item
compared to some of the hateful things she has said
about me. And why? Simply because I didn’t
stay near her every minute at the frolic.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Bess; we have heard all that lingo before,”
Lola said with a touch of insolent indifference.
“We know your trials with the ‘baby elephant.’
What do you expect us to do about it? <em>We</em> simply
ignore her. You do the same and she will let you
alone.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do more than that. I think,” Elizabeth lowered
her voice, “she ought to be hazed.”
</p>
<p>
“No <em>sir-ee</em>!” Lola’s lips set tightly after the
totally disapproving ejaculation. “Don’t you ever
mention hazing in this room. You must be crazy.
Why were the Sans expelled? For hazing Miss
Dean. You know that. Do you imagine for a second
that Alida and I, in our <em>senior year</em>, would
take the chances Les Cairns did?”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t haze <em>anyone</em>,” declared Alida emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“Wise child; neither would I.” Lola fixed half
scornful eyes on Elizabeth. “What ever made you
light upon such a foolhardy idea? Where and how
would you haze her?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know yet what I would do,” pouted Elizabeth.
“There are lots of ways of hazing a person.
The girls have done a few little things to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
room, as it is. Nothing was said to them about it.”
She related with relish the tricks that had been
played on Gussie.
</p>
<p>
“All that’s <em>hazing</em>,” flatly maintained Lola. “This
freshie must be pretty white or she would have
reported it to Remson. You say nothing’s been
said. That means she can keep her affairs to herself.”
</p>
<p>
“Hm-m!” Elizabeth made a pettish gesture.
“You are queer. One minute you talk against this
hateful creature, the next you praise her. It’s a
clear case of blow hot, blow cold with you, Lola.”
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t like my ways, you had best stay
away from me.” Lola half closed her eyes. Her
expression was one of utter boredom.
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth made no answer to this. She was not
ready to stay away from Lola.
</p>
<p>
“Let me tell you something, Bess.” Alida now
took the floor, shaking a warning finger at their
caller. “Don’t come to us with any scheme for getting
even with someone you don’t like. We are not
going in for revenge this season. If a really clever
scout like Leslie Cairns couldn’t get away with it,
neither you nor I could. That is certain.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t know. I can’t say I think Leslie
was so very clever. She bore the reputation of
being a wonder worker, but she made plenty of flivvers.
I could have engineered that hazing of Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
Dean and carried it through successfully. She
made an awful mess of it.”
</p>
<p>
“I never heard the rights of that affair, so I can’t
pass opinion on what you just said.” Lola’s tones
were dry to displeasure. She knew enough concerning
their caller’s proclivity toward malicious
gossiping to weigh well her words. “I prefer to
drop the subject entirely, Bess. It does not interest
me. Get it straight, once and for all, Alida and I
know when we are well off. We aren’t contemplating
any changes in our programme, least of all foolish
changes.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well.” The reply bristled with offended
vanity. It was gall to the conscienceless junior to
be thus baldly snubbed. “You girls are <em>very</em> magnanimous.
Perhaps you haven’t heard much that
Miss Forbes has said against both of you. I assure
you it has been <em>considerable</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Let her rave.” Lola shrewdly ignored the bait
thrown out by Elizabeth.
</p>
<p>
“How does it happen that you always hear more
of such gossip than any other girl on the campus
whom we know?” demanded Alida a trifle sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t.” The red poured into Elizabeth’s
cheeks at this thrust. “You two stick together all
the time. That’s why you are not in touch with
campus gossip, as you call it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“I see as much of this lovely aggregation as I
care to,” Lola yawned. “Forget it, Bess. You
can’t stir us into action with that kind of bluff.
You are looking for trouble. You thought it would
be nice to have us help you hunt it. Nay, nay, my
child! It simply isn’t being done in our circle.”
</p>
<p>
“I might have known better than come to you.
I——”
</p>
<p>
“First sensible thing you’ve said since you came
in here,” murmured Lola.
</p>
<p>
“You are simply <em>hateful</em>, Lola Elster! Good
night!” Elizabeth rose with an angry flop and
made for the door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, good night,” called Lola tantalizingly after
her, as she banged the door. Lola turned to Alida,
laughing. “That settles her. How she does hate
to have her bluff called! Little she cares what that
Forbes kid says against us. She only thinks of herself.
If we were silly enough to help her in her
schemes, we’d get the worst of it in the long run.
If trouble came she’d slide from under and leave us
to bear the brunt of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t I know it?” nodded Alida. “Bess is good
company when she chooses to be, but I never feel
that she can be trusted. If I had mentioned to her
tonight that I did not like Miss Forbes, I’d probably
hear next week that I had said she was a villain of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
the deepest dye and that I was going to have
her expelled from Hamilton. Bess weaves a whole
hut from one wisp of straw.”
</p>
<p>
“I decline to furnish a single wisp, then,” Lola
said lightly. “Bess is riding to a fall. I propose to
be so far away from her when it happens that I
won’t hear the crash.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>CHAPTER XV—INTERNAL WAR</h2>
<p>
Marjorie thought that she had never longed so
much for a holiday to come as Thanksgiving. She
was eager to go home and see her general and captain.
Then there was Connie’s wedding to be considered.
Her mother had written her that the gown
she was to wear as maid of honor to Constance was
ready and waiting for her. Marjorie did not know
its color, texture, what kind of wedding Connie was
to have as to color scheme. All of that was being
kept away from her as a delightful secret. Naturally
she had a lively yearning for home and its joyous
surprises.
</p>
<p>
There was also the question of the boarding-house
proposition which could not be answered until
after Thanksgiving. She hoped the owner would
not disappoint her and Robin again by remaining
away from Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
She made a valiant effort to forget her own
yearnings in taking a kindly interest in basket ball
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
practice, which went on almost every afternoon in
the gymnasium. She soon found that the scrub and
official sophomore teams welcomed her presence at
practice. The freshman team did not. Gussie
Forbes glowered rudely at her whenever she
chanced to be near enough. The two freshmen forwards,
friends of Elizabeth Walbert’s, showed disfavor
of Marjorie’s attendance. The other two
freshman players took color, chameleon-like, from
the belligerent trio and cast indifferently unfriendly
glances in her direction.
</p>
<p>
It did not take Marjorie long to fathom this state
of affairs. While it amused her, she was mildly
resentful of it. Resolved not to be intimidated by
a few black looks, she calmly ignored the situation.
Soon, however, she began to notice that internal
war raged on that particular team. As center, Augusta
Forbes had not struck a bed of roses. With
four of her team-mates arrayed against her, her
position had become well-nigh unbearable.
</p>
<p>
Her childish heart wrapped up in basket ball, she
exhibited a noteworthy patience. She was keenly
proud of her position on the team and worked with
might and main, schooling herself to be indifferent
to the contemptible little stings delivered by her
team-mates. Considering her tempestuous disposition,
she showed remarkable self-restraint, an indication
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
of the fine young woman she would become
when college had worn away the rough edges.
</p>
<p>
“See here, Marvelous Manager,” Jerry began one
afternoon as the two stood watching a bit of snappy
playing, which Augusta had just exhibited. “<em>L’enfant
terrible</em> is not getting a fair deal. Did you
know that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, <em>I know it</em>,” replied Marjorie with savage
emphasis. “It is too bad. Something will have to
be done about it. I have noticed it before today.
I wanted to see if the rest of the committee would.
I wished to be sure that I wasn’t over critical.
Muriel mentioned it to me last week. Robin and
Elaine noticed that the team was at loggerheads on
Tuesday. I hardly know how to proceed. I hate
to call a meeting of the team and lay down the law
to them. It will only make Miss Forbes’ position
more uncomfortable, I am afraid. She plays with
her whole heart. They keep one eye on their game
and the other on her.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s a star player,” praised Jerry. “I can’t
help but admire her for the way she plugs along
under such stress. Yes, Marj, <em>l’enfant terrible</em>
will turn out well, I predict, even if she never learns
to appreciate us.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to be Marj’s duty to wind up this
snarl,” commented Marjorie satirically. “I do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
relish the task. I wish the freshies would not
jangle. The soph team is positively seraphic.”
</p>
<p>
While Marjorie was casting about in her fertile
brain for a good opening toward adjusting matters
on the freshman team, the way opened with amazing
celerity. She had attended practice on Thursday.
The following Monday she had not. It being
a rainy afternoon there were almost no spectators.
An altercation rose between a girl on the scrub team
which the freshies were pitted against, and Augusta.
The scrub player claimed a foul on Gussie which
the latter hotly contested. Gussie’s team-mates stood
up for the scrub. The end of her patience reached,
she turned on them all in a fury of words, stinging
and truthful.
</p>
<p>
“The whole trouble with you four girls is you
want to see me off the team,” she concluded. “Sorry
I can’t oblige you, I mean glad. I play fairly. But
you say, I do not. In your hearts you know I do.
You had best tend to your own playing instead of
picking flaws with me. I play a better game than
any of you. If we lose the first game of the season,
it won’t be my fault.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing conceited about you, is there?” sneered
Alma Hurst, the most disagreeable of the four objectors.
</p>
<p>
“I know what I can do on the floor,” composedly
retorted Gussie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I know what I can do off the floor,”
threatened Alma. “We would have a fine team if
it weren’t for you. It’s a case of four against one.
I think our word will stand. I shall see that it
does.”
</p>
<p>
“Go as far as you like,” scornfully dared Gussie.
“You can’t bother me.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see about that,” asserted Alma, and
walked away, accompanied by her three irate supporters.
</p>
<p>
Gussie left the gymnasium that afternoon with
a heavy heart. She had defied the quartette of
oppressors, but she had no faith in herself.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I’m done for,” she reflected gloomily,
as she forged through a driving rain to Wayland
Hall. “They will complain to the sports committee
or to Professor Leonard. Those seniors on the
sports committee hate me. They will be perfectly
delighted to put me off the team. They will make
Professor Leonard think I am the most hateful,
cheating person on the campus and he will ask me
to resign. Just as though I would cheat in basket
ball. There’d be no fun in playing unfairly.”
Gussie choked back a low sob. She dashed her hand
angrily across her eyes. “I won’t cry. I’m not such
a big baby as that, I hope.”
</p>
<p>
On the following afternoon Marjorie found a
note, in the bulletin board at the Hall, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
brought a quick light of anger to her brown eyes.
It read:
</p>
<p style='text-align:left; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:2em;;'>Miss Marjorie Dean,</p>

<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
We appeal to you to take prompt action in the
case of Miss Augusta Forbes who is a detriment to
the freshman team. She is rough and unfair in her
playing. Besides, she has accused us of being untruthful
and used what we should call harsh language
to us. We try to work peacefully and in
harmony, but she is so unruly we simply cannot
endure her. As there are four of us, all of the
same opinion, I think our plea should be heard and
this disturber removed from the team. Let us hear
from you in the way of justice.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>Yours truly,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>&#160;</p>

<p>
“They’ll certainly hear from me,” Marjorie commented,
a smile flickering about the corners of her
mouth. “As for <em>l’enfant terrible</em>. Poor old child!”
</p>
<p>
She sat down on the top step of the landing,
where she had so often paused to read her letters,
and re-read the preemptory letter. She continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
to sit there for a little while, evidently turning over
in her mind something that had more than once
visited it.
</p>
<p>
Unable to decide, she rose and went on up the
stairs. Stopping only to lay her notebooks on the
center table of her room, she next sought Muriel.
</p>
<p>
“Read that.” She dropped the letter on the table
before which Muriel sat writing industriously.
</p>
<p>
Muriel glanced through and gave a short, scornful
laugh, “Nothing like asking for what one
wants. Such a modest request! Strip the team of
its shining light to please four sore-heads! What
are you going to say to the big four?”
</p>
<p>
“Enough in a few words to let them understand
that I understand them. I needed your official support.
I see I have it. I knew I had already. Now
I shall show this effusion to Robin and Elaine. I
am going over to Silverton Hall. If Jerry comes
here hunting me, tell her I’ll be back in time for
dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. Be sure to write those snippies a
good, stiff letter, and let me see it,” called Muriel
after Marjorie as she went out the door.
</p>
<p>
Robin and Elaine were equally disapproving of
the letter written by Miss Hurst.
</p>
<p>
“I think Miss Forbes should be told of this attempt
to oust her from the team. Of course she
must have known all along of their feeling against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
her. That accounts for the lack of fellowship
among them that I noticed last Tuesday. It is not
fair to keep her in the dark about it,” Robin declared.
</p>
<p>
“I had thought of telling her,” Marjorie said
slowly. “I could write these kickers the kind of
letter they need. They would then either have to
treat Miss Forbes well or I should ask for their
resignations from the team. They are in the wrong,
I am sure. I will not countenance any injustice to
any player while I am chairman of the sports committee.
I feel, however, that I ought to ask Miss
Forbes for her side of the matter in fairness to
them. They have stated their case against her.”
</p>
<p>
“So you should,” Robin was quick to agree.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, by all means, tell her, Marjorie,” advocated
gentle Elaine. “Then she will be sure that we are
standing up for her.”
</p>
<p>
This was good advice. Unfortunately, neither
Robin nor Elaine knew of Gussie’s unreasonable
attitude toward Marjorie. She considered this
phase of the affair rather ruefully as she walked
across the campus through the November dusk.
Her best method of approaching Gussie was to go
to her room. Then if the recalcitrant “Gus” refused
to talk with her, no one other than Florence Hart,
Gussie’s room-mate, would be present at the failure.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to in and see Miss Forbes,” Marjorie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
informed Jerry with a sigh. Jerry had been allowed
to read the annoying letter.
</p>
<p>
“How nice!” satirized Jerry. “You had better
poke your head in at her door, say what you must
and beat it back here in a hurry. You will be perfectly
safe, at least, if you follow my advice.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie pictured this move on her part and giggled.
“I think I’ll go and see her now. I have just
time enough before dinner. If I put it off it will be
harder and harder to do. I don’t wish to go one
single bit, Jeremiah.” Her laughing face suddenly
sobered.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame you. Still, it may all turn out for
the best. Perhaps if this big goose understands that
you are trying to help her she will change her
policy. Glad I’m not on that sports committee. I
have all I can do to manage Jerry Jeremiah Geraldine
Macy, let alone managing anyone else.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>CHAPTER XVI—ADMINISTRATING JUSTICE</h2>
<p>
Marjorie started down the hall on her difficult
errand, wondering what to say first to Gussie
Forbes. She hoped Miss Hart would answer the
door. Were Gussie to do so she might easily close
the door in her caller’s face. Having something of
importance to say, Marjorie was anxious to say it
and close the subject.
</p>
<p>
She knocked twice before an answer came. When
the door opened, she found herself looking into the
frowning face of <em>l’enfant terrible</em>. Before Gussie
could close the door, had she intended to do so,
Marjorie spoke with pretty impulsiveness.
</p>
<p>
“May I come in for a few moments, Miss Forbes?
I wish particularly to see you.”
</p>
<p>
For answer Gussie merely opened the door wider
and stood aside for Marjorie to pass her. She
thought she understood the nature of the call. Miss
Dean had come to tell her she was no longer a
member of the freshman team. Well, she was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
afraid to face this senior who had made fun of her
on sight.
</p>
<p>
“Will you have a chair?” she said formally, closing
the door and coming forward until she stood
directly in front of her caller.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you.” Marjorie sat down, her brown
eyes fixed on her reserved hostess. There was a
world of kindness in their beautiful depths which
Gussie could not overlook. She reluctantly sprang
to the conclusion: “She’s sorry for me. She wants
to let me down easily.”
</p>
<p>
“I have brought with me a letter, Miss Forbes.
I should like you to read it. It displeased the sports
committee very much. I beg of you not to take it
to heart. It is not worth one minute’s discomfort
on your part.”
</p>
<p>
Gussie accepted the letter in wonder. This explanation
of Marjorie’s did not tally with what she
had expected the senior would say. A bright flush
mantled her checks as she read it.
</p>
<p>
“They threatened to do this,” she said dully as
she returned the letter to Marjorie. “I play basket
ball fairly. I am not rough, either. I had a fuss
with a girl on the scrub team yesterday. The rest
of our team stood up for her instead of me. I
would have resigned before this, only I like to play
basket ball. I saw no reason why I should give up
my position.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
“There is no reason why you should not play,”
warmly returned Marjorie. “No one could play a
fairer game than you. Our committee have watched
and admired your playing. All four of us used to
play on the college teams. So we know a star
player when we see one. Only lately we all saw
that you were not being fairly treated. We had
decided to put an end to such unfairness when I
received this letter. I have seen the others on the
sports committee. They are of the same mind as
myself. We shall see that justice is done you.”
</p>
<p>
Augusta’s face had begun to clear as Marjorie
talked. It brightened with each succeeding word.
She forgot her earlier grudge against the other girl.
She was hearing herself appreciated and it was very
sweet to her.
</p>
<p>
“If these four players on the freshman team,”
Marjorie continued, “refuse to be amicable on the
floor, the sports committee will demand <em>their</em> resignations.
We have the authority to do so and shall
use it if necessary. It is our aim to have only pleasantness
in connection with basket ball. Friendly
rivalry between teams and harmony among the
members of each team. That is the only basis on
which to conduct college sports. I have seen it
tried the other way, and it doesn’t pay.”
</p>
<p>
“If they resigned, then there wouldn’t be any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
freshman team,” stammered Gussie, thinking instantly
of this dire calamity.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes there would,” Marjorie assured with a
friendly laugh. “You would be center on a new
team. Your position on the freshman team is safe.
Please understand that, Miss Forbes. The other
freshmen may find theirs shaky.”
</p>
<p>
Gussie stared at Marjorie with wide, solemn eyes.
“I did not know you were like this,” she blurted.
“What was the matter with me that I misjudged
you so? I thought you and Miss Macy made fun
of me on the first evening we were at Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Macy made some funny remarks about the
noise you were all making and about you being
freshies,” Marjorie felt impelled to confess, “but she
did not intend to be ill-natured. We laughed, because,
Jeremiah, as we call her, is almost always
funny.”
</p>
<p>
“You will never forgive me,” was Gussie’s shame-faced
prognostication. “The girls told me I had
made a mistake. I wouldn’t listen to them. I don’t
deserve your kindness to me, Miss Dean. When
Miss Hurst said she was going to have me dropped
from the team, I thought you would be glad of an
excuse to drop me. So you can see for yourself
what a horrid, suspicious person I am.”
</p>
<p>
For answer Marjorie laughed merrily. “I think
you are very honest and straightforward,” she differed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
“I am not sorry this letter was written. It
has brought us an understanding of each other
which should lead to friendship. If I were in your
place, Miss Forbes, I would go on working on the
team precisely as though nothing had happened. I
shall write Miss Hurst this evening. I imagine
after she receives my letter she will stop this annoying
persecution. That is what it amounts to.”
</p>
<p>
After a little further conversation with the now
placated Gussie, Marjorie shook hands with her and
left her in a beatified state of mind.
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing truer than that old proverb,
‘It’s an ill wind that blows no one good,’” was Marjorie’s
salutation as she entered her room. “By
rights I should send Miss Hurst a note of thanks
for putting me on good terms with Miss Forbes.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie’s gay utterance was indicative of the
success of her errand. She was genuinely happy
over the change in Augusta Forbes toward herself.
Had Gussie been one of whom her upright mind
could not truly approve, she would not have been
annoyed at the freshman’s misunderstanding of her.
Knowing the stubborn girl to be sterling at heart,
it had hurt Marjorie to be thus misjudged. It had
hurt her still more to know that Augusta saw Jerry
in a false light
</p>
<p>
“I notice you weren’t extinguished,” commented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
Jerry, her eyes resting with fond humor upon her
pretty chum. “Tell me about it.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie complied with the request. She finished
with: “I explained a little about that night we saw
her at Baretti’s; assured her we weren’t making fun
of her. I asked her to come and see us soon. She
said she would. She will know, after she has talked
with you about five minutes, Jeremiah, that you are
the best old treasure that ever was.”
</p>
<p>
“Am I so wonderful as all that? Dear me!”
Jerry simpered, raising her chubby hands in mock
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you are, and you know it.” Marjorie made
an affectionate little rush at Jerry and caught her
around the waist. In the absence of Captain and
General, she sometimes treated Jerry to these sudden,
playful proofs of her affection. Nothing
pleased Jerry more.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t have time to write an answer to Miss
Hurst’s note,” she said, glancing at the clock. “I’ll
do it directly after dinner and mail it before eight-thirty.
There is a mail collection at nine. I want
it to reach her tomorrow morning. I shall attend
practice tomorrow afternoon and see that Miss
Forbes has fair play.” The determined glint in
Marjorie’s eyes spelled justice to the injured party.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie did not linger at the dinner table that
evening. She hastened upstairs the moment she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
had eaten dessert and set to work at the letter. Her
fountain pen poised thoughtfully over the paper, she
considered Miss Hurst’s note for a brief season.
Then she wrote:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“<span class='sc'>Dear Miss Hurst</span>:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Your letter received. In justice to Miss Forbes
I would say that her case has been under observation
of the sports committee for the past week. The
findings are these—she is a fine and honorable
player, conforming to the rules of basket ball in
every respect. She is not a disturber, in any sense,
and the sports committee must refuse to countenance
unfair reports against her. I find her scrupulously
truthful. The committee have not been
pleased with the churlish treatment which has been
accorded Miss Forbes by the other members of the
team. We would advocate a marked change on the
part of yourself and your team-mates in this direction.
Personal spite makes poor team work.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“<span class='sc'>Marjorie Dean</span>,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Chairman Sports Committee.”</p>
<p>
“There!” she exclaimed, as she addressed an envelope
to Alma Hurst at Acasia House. “That
unpleasant labor is out of the way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
“Let me read it?” begged Jerry. “You need my
official criticism.”
</p>
<p>
“Read it, then. You don’t allow me to have any
secrets from you,” Marjorie complained in feigned
vexation.
</p>
<p>
“No indeed,” emphasized Jerry. “Good work,”
she approved, having read the letter. “The real
straight-from-the-shoulder variety. That ought to
give pause to the Amalgamated Sorehead Society.
That’s a fine name for them. I shall tell it to
Gloomy Gus when she and I grow to be bosom
friends.”
</p>
<p>
“Better not,” warned Marjorie, breaking into
laughter. “She is quite capable of hurling it at
them in a moment of wrath. Don’t furnish her
with ammunition. She is a handful, all by herself.”
</p>
<p>
Drawing on her fur coat, for the evening was
snappy with frost, Marjorie went bareheaded out
of the Hall and across the campus, diagonally to the
nearest mail-box. About to cross the main drive
on the return to the house, she stood aside for a
passing car. The glare of an arc light over the
drive picked out plainly the faces of the two occupants
of the car. They did not note her, she being
in the shadow.
</p>
<p>
“Oh-h!” a soft little breath of surprise escaped
her. She remained in the shadow watching the
car. It stopped in front of Wayland Hall. One of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
the occupants, Elizabeth Walbert, left the car and
hurried up the steps of the Hall. The car turned
in the open space before the house, darted away instantly.
It shot past Marjorie at high speed. This
time she hardly glimpsed the driver’s face. She
had already recognized it, however, as that of Leslie
Cairns. She had not withdrawn into the shadow
for the purpose of spying upon the two girls. She
had merely preferred not to encounter them. She
resolved to tell no one of having seen Leslie on the
campus. She could not refrain from wondering at
the ex-senior’s temerity, in thus invading a territory
now forbidden to her.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>CHAPTER XVII—THE CULMINATION OF A ROMANCE</h2>
<p>
“It’s a perfectly sweet dress! Of course it is
just a wee, tiny bit better than any other you’ve
ever given me, you two old dears!”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie made her usual loving onslaught upon
her smiling general and captain who sat side by
side on the living room davenport admiring her.
It was the evening of Constance Stevens’ wedding
and Marjorie was proudly parading her maid of
honor frock before her indulgent parents. She had
just come down stairs and was bubbling over with
happiness at the beauty of the gown, her flowers,
and the prospect in general directly ahead of her.
</p>
<p>
“Right face. Forward march to the end of the
room,” ordered General Dean, gently holding Marjorie
off from him. “Your distinguished captain and
I can’t judge your fine feathers at such close
range.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie obediently paraded the length of the
room and back, a vision of youthful enchantment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
The pale yellow of her satin gown brought out vividly
her dark hair and starry eyes. She had once
given Connie a blue gown. This time Connie had
been the donor. She had also insisted on furnishing
even the white velvet evening coat, lined with the
same satin as Marjorie’s frock, along with the
other accessories of the costume. It lay across a
chair, waiting for its lovely wearer. On the center
table reposed a huge cluster of yellow chrysanthemums,
tied with pale satin ribbon.
</p>
<p>
“Break ranks. Time for the gallant army to
move on.” Mr. Dean consulted his watch.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t say what you thought of my frock,”
Marjorie reminded.
</p>
<p>
“I dare not. I have no desire to encourage vanity
in my own child. Besides, soldiers don’t wear
frocks. They wear uniforms,” teased Mr. Dean.
</p>
<p>
“Much obliged,” Marjorie nodded saucy thanks.
“I mean for the compliment. It was a compliment,
even though obscure.”
</p>
<p>
“You are so welcome,” gushed Mr. Dean. “Let
me offer the army my arms.” He politely crooked
his elbows to his wife and daughter.
</p>
<p>
Laughing, the two accepted his gallant offer, and
the trio swept grandly from the living room.
</p>
<p>
“Captain deserves a whole lot of compliments,”
Marjorie declared as they walked down the drive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
three abreast to the limousine. “She looks so beautiful
tonight!”
</p>
<p>
“I had already observed that fact,” returned her
general, his eyes admiringly resting on his wife.
Always a beautiful woman, Mrs. Dean was particularly
distinctive in the white lace gown she was
wearing. “You haven’t complimented me yet,” he
pointedly added.
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t ask for praise. Just be nice and
folks will praise you of their own accord,” Marjorie
gave his arm a vigorous pinch.
</p>
<p>
“I see!” He appeared to ponder. “Pretty is as
pretty does. I suppose that cruel pinch belongs
with the advice.”
</p>
<p>
“It does. Want another?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you. One more and I shall balk.
Then who will see you to the wedding?”
</p>
<p>
In this frolicsome strain the Deans set out for
Gray Gables to see the beautiful culmination of a
romance begun with Marjorie’s gift of a blue dress
to a girl who had known little then of happiness.
</p>
<p>
As Constance had said to Marjorie, on the night
of Jerry’s and Hal’s dance, only her near and dear
ones were to be present at her marriage to Lawrence
Armitage. This happy event was to take
place at Gray Gables at eight o’clock that evening.
</p>
<p>
Due to the time of year, Constance had decided
on a chrysanthemum wedding, these being her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
foster father, Mr. Stevens’, favorite flowers. Laurie
held Mr. Stevens next to his own father in affection.
He reverenced him as a master musician. Both he
and Constance were glad to defer to his preference
in this respect.
</p>
<p>
During the drive to Gray Gables, Marjorie found
her mother’s hand and held it. She was feeling
rather emotional in a very quiet fashion. Connie’s
wedding was not yet quite a reality. Could it be
that at eight o’clock that evening Connie was actually
to be married? It seemed only yesterday that
she and Constance were walking home from high
school, grumbling over the length of next days’
French lesson.
</p>
<p>
Her captain understanding her sudden change of
mood asked no questions, simply passed her free
arm about Marjorie’s shoulders. Only the day before
she had observed to her husband: “Here is our
Constance on the eve of marriage. Marjorie is still
nothing but a large child. Her ideas of love are
very vague.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad of it,” Mr. Dean had returned. “I
hope her romance to come is still far distant.”
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Gray Gables they found the large
square reception hall and drawing room had been
converted into a chrysanthemum bower. The clean
fresh scent of chrysanthemums filled the air. At the
foot of the wide staircase were two huge vases of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
large, fringed, white mums. From this point a white
ribboned aisle began which extended to one end of
the drawing room, where an exquisite banking of
palms and yellow and white mums marked the spot
before which Constance and Laurie would stand to
repeat their vows of deathless love and loyalty.
Along each side of the ribboned way bloomed a
hedge of golden and white mums of the small, bushy
variety. The aisles reminded Marjorie of the chrysanthemum
walk at Wayland Hall, designed by
Brooke Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
“Go on up stairs, Marjorie,” Miss Allison directed,
after welcoming the Deans. “Constance
looks so lovely. She is waiting anxiously for you.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie needed no second instructions. She
ran up the stairs in her usual buoyant fashion and
knocked at a familiar door.
</p>
<p>
“Come in.” Constance rose from before her
dressing table as Marjorie entered. The two met in
the middle of the room and embraced. For a long
moment they stood thus. In the eyes of each were
tears which they both strove to check.
</p>
<p>
“I’m so happy, Marjorie, and sad, and my feelings
are a general jumble,” half sobbed Constance.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie nodded through tears. “I know. I
feel that way, too, just because it’s you. I don’t
want to cry and make my eyelids pink and neither
do you,” she added with a tremulous laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
This brought a smile to Constance’s lovely but distinctly
solemn features. The first rush of emotion
past, the chums felt better.
</p>
<p>
“How dear you are in your wedding gown!”
Marjorie exclaimed. She had now stepped far
enough away from Constance to obtain a good view
of her. The dress was of heavy white satin, beautiful
in its simplicity of design. On a white-covered
stand nearby lay the long fine lace veil with its perfumed
garniture of lilies of the valley and orange
blossoms. Beside it was the bride’s bouquet, a
shower of the same sweet lilies and orange blossoms.
</p>
<p>
“This is Laurie’s gift to me.” Constance touched
tenderly a string of luscious pearls adorning her
white throat. “I want you to help me adjust my
veil. Aunt Susan’s maid wished to, but I wouldn’t
let her. I preferred you to do it, Marjorie.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d love to. You know that,” Marjorie left off
admiring the pearls to make this warm assurance.
“Go and sit on your dressing-table chair. Then you
can see me fix your veil and be sure that you are
satisfied with it.”
</p>
<p>
Constance obediently complied. Marjorie lightly
lifted the fairy-like bridal insignia and placed it
upon her friend’s head.
</p>
<p>
“I am your fairy god-mother,” she said in a dramatic
voice. “On your wedding night I come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
bring you every known happiness. I place the chaplet
of love upon your head and grant you a long,
untroubled life.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls laughed at this bit of fancy, the oval
mirror reflecting a charming picture as Marjorie
carefully adjusted the veil over Connie’s golden
curls.
</p>
<p>
Presently the floor clock in the room ticked off
ten minutes to eight. Next Miss Allison entered
with: “Are you ready, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Auntie.” Constance rose and held out
both hands to the woman whose great-heartedness
had changed the current of her whole life. “I wish
I could thank you for all you’ve done for me, Aunt
Susan,” she said with wistful sincerity. “It is so
beautiful to have this kind of wedding from the
home you gave me and surrounded by my very best
friends.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, child,” declared Miss Allison with
gentle energy. “Think of all you have given me
to make me happy. Though I shall miss you more
when you are in Europe, simply because you are
farther away, I feel this to be a particularly wonderful
ending of a Thanksgiving Day. Now I must
leave you girls and go on down stairs. Be ready to
descend on the first notes of the wedding march,
Connie. Don’t keep your bridegroom waiting.”
With this touch of humor she left them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
As Mr. Stevens, Uncle John Roland and little
Charlie were detailed to give away the bride, Professor
Harmon, Laurie’s old friend at Weston High
School, and three members of the Sanford orchestra
formerly directed by Mr. Stevens, had been invited
to play the wedding music.
</p>
<p>
With the first dulcet strains of Mendelssohn’s
immortal Wedding March, Constance began a slow
descent of the staircase, followed by Marjorie. It
seemed eminently fitting that Marjorie, who had
so loyally stood by Constance through thick and
thin, should now be making this short though momentous
pilgrimage with her.
</p>
<p>
At the foot of the stairs, Laurie, looking handsomer
than Marjorie had ever before seen him,
awaited his bride. Hal, his boyhood friend, stood
beside him. Marjorie flashed him a bright, friendly
glance as the two of them fell in behind their chums
and began the walk through the flowery aisle to the
bank of chrysanthemums. There Mr. Armitage,
Miss Allison, Uncle John, Mr. Stevens and Charlie
awaited them. Laurie had wished matters thus
arranged.
</p>
<p>
Gathered informally in the spacious room were
the Lookouts of the original chapter, Miss Archer,
Mr. La Salle, two or three Weston High School
instructors whom Laurie had specially liked, a dozen
or more of his high school comrades, two or three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
friends of his father’s, and his dead mother’s only
sister. These made up the wedding guests. As the
last telling strains of the wedding march died into
that impressive silence which always immediately
precedes the bridal ceremony, the company moved
forward and formed a wide, worshiping circle
about the wedding party. Then the rector of the
Sanford Episcopal Church began the fine, old Episcopalian
ring service.
</p>
<p>
It was the first wedding in which Marjorie had
taken a part more important than that of guest.
Constance was also the first one of the Lookouts to
be married. So thoroughly impressed was she with
Constance and Laurie, she gave no special thought
to Hal. He was wondering with might and main
if Marjorie might possibly awaken to love as a
result of the marriage of the best friend of each of
them. Hal had learned his lesson, however, on the
night of the dance he and Jerry had given. He had
then understood definitely that Marjorie wished to
keep far away from any sentiment for him deeper
than friendship. He was resolved to keep to this
plane, no matter how bitterly it grieved him. He
would never give Marjorie up as his prospective
wife until he heard from her own lips that she did
not love him. Still, he would never again make the
faintest approach toward sentiment unless he saw
for himself that it was not distasteful to her. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
had set a hard task for himself. He was determined
to carry it through. Boyishly, he told himself that
if ever he asked Marjorie to marry him and she
refused him, he would never marry.
</p>
<p>
The ceremony over, Constance was passed from
one to another of her dear ones, while Laurie received
the firm handclasps of his men friends. As
the hands of Hal and Laurie met, their eyes exchanged
glances. In Laurie’s was untold sympathy.
In Hal’s was an expression which might have been
either fortitude or proud resignation. Laurie could
not judge which. He could only hope, as he had
recently told Constance, that Marjorie would wake
up some day to what a real prince old Hal was.
</p>
<p>
Solemnity, even momentary, could not long survive
the unique presence of Charlie Stevens. Hardly
had the first congratulations been extended when
Charlie loudly expressed himself to Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“I was going to marry you myself, Marj’rie, but
I sha’n’t. You’re a good deal too tall and old to
make me a nice wife,” he pleasantly observed.
“That’s quite a pretty dress you’ve got on. Someone
else, maybe someone as tall as Laurie or Hal
might like to marry you—someday. I wouldn’t. I
like you, Marj’rie, ’bout the best of all, next to
Connie and Mary Raymond, but I’d rather stay at
home with Uncle John than get married.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think it is just as well you changed your mind,
Charlie.” Marjorie joined in the laughter at her
expense. Her color had deepened a trifle at Charlie’s
hopeful prophecy that someone as tall as Hal
might like to marry her some day.
</p>
<p>
“I think so, too,” Charlie agreed importantly.
“I may get married when I’m about a hundred.
I’ll be a good deal taller then. I and my wife will
come to your house to see Delia and have her give
us some choc’lit cake.”
</p>
<p>
Well satisfied with this plan, he trotted off after
his idol, Uncle John Roland, who could not look at
Connie without tears. He had left the group gathered
about the bridal couple until he was again able
to control his emotions.
</p>
<p>
Laurie and Constance had elected to spend a
week’s honeymoon in the Armitages’ New York
home, which Laurie had been preparing for his
bride for three months before their marriage. From
there they would sail for Europe. They were to
leave Sanford on the eleven o’clock express for New
York.
</p>
<p>
Constance’s last act before changing her wedding
dress for travel attire was to throw her bouquet
from the open staircase down among her girl
friends. Muriel Harding captured it, thereby bringing
down upon herself plenty of good-natured raillery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
Marjorie had tried with the others to catch
the bouquet, as a matter of sport. She was secretly
glad when it fled past her and almost into Muriel’s
hands. While she had taken the utmost interest in
Connie’s wedding, she did not wish to be reminded,
even by a fragrant floral sign, that somewhere in
the future lurked a wedding day for herself.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>CHAPTER XVIII—BLACK DISAPPOINTMENT</h2>
<p>
Returned to Hamilton from the Thanksgiving
holiday, the most important subject on Marjorie’s
horizon was that of the real estate transaction she
and Robin Page hoped to close with Mr. Cutler.
He had stated that the owner of the boarding house
properties would be in Hamilton after Thanksgiving.
Both she and Robin were impatient to hear
from the agent, yet neither felt like forcing matters.
</p>
<p>
It was over a week after Thanksgiving when
Marjorie joyfully pounced upon a letter in the Hall
bulletin board, addressed to her, and bearing the
agent’s printed address in the upper left hand
corner. The four typed lines which comprised the
letter stated that the owner of the properties in
which they were interested would be in Hamilton
on the following Monday. Mr. Cutler requested
them to call at his office at four o’clock of the succeeding
Wednesday afternoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be glad to have this part of our great undertaking
settled and off my mind,” Marjorie buoyantly
told Robin that afternoon as the two girls left
Science Hall together. Marjorie had stopped at
the Biological Laboratory for Robin in order to
acquaint her with the welcome news.
</p>
<p>
“When we know definitely how much the properties
are going to cost us we will have more incentive
to go ahead and rush our first show of the
season through. Nothing like knowing exactly
where one stands, is there?” Robin finished interrogatively.
</p>
<p>
Marjorie quickly agreed with this statement. Her
naturally orderly mind clamored for the suspense
to end so that the real work might begin.
</p>
<p>
“It will be a good thing to have it off our chests
by Wednesday,” she congratulated. “Saturday’s
the first freshie-soph game, you know. We will
have to be present. I can look forward to enjoying
it, with this important question settled.”
</p>
<p>
“Did that Miss Hurst answer your note?” Robin
inquired. “I meant to ask you that before and kept
forgetting it.”
</p>
<p>
“No, she did not. The team practiced on the
Friday after I wrote it. I dropped in purposely to
watch those four girls. There were at least fifty
students there besides myself. Miss Forbes made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
a beautiful toss to basket. You should have heard
the applause. The four kickers looked miffed but
they didn’t try any hatefulness with her, so far as
I could see. I asked her that evening if matters
had improved in that respect and she said they certainly
had. I haven’t been to practice since Thanksgiving.”
</p>
<p>
“I stopped at the gym yesterday to watch the
freshies. Phil was anxious to see them work. Miss
Forbes was leading the team, as usual, in fast work.
She seemed to be getting along with them very well.
Your letter had a potent effect, I guess. I have no
patience with small natures.” Robin frowned her
utter contempt for such marked ignobility.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I. If Miss Forbes should play a brilliant
game on next Saturday she would be established as
a star and her team-mates would have to be very
careful how they treated her afterward. I hope she
does. I believe she will.”
</p>
<p>
With that Marjorie changed the subject by asking
Robin to go to the Hall with her and remain
to dinner. “We can go a long way toward planning
our next entertainment. I imagine a play would be
interesting for a starter. Leila makes a fine stage
manager. Katherine Langly wrote a romantic play
called ‘The Maid of Honor.’ It is a truly thrilling
drama of the English Court during the reign of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
Queen Elizabeth. During my soph year we talked
of giving it. Miss Remson said there was a large
cedar chest in the attic of the Hall full of courtier
costumes. The students of several years back used
them in giving Shakespearian plays.” Marjorie’s
usual resourcefulness came to the surface.
</p>
<p>
“That would be great!” Robin was all enthusiasm
at the proposal. “Katherine Langly ought to
become a writer or a playwright or something literary.
She has written articles and verses and short
stories, so I have heard, just for literary practice.
She has never tried to sell one of them. She belongs
to the Silver Pen, doesn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. She was invited to join it during her
freshman year. Think of that! She composed a
theme for her English class, and the style was so
perfect, Miss Faber read it out to the class,” related
Marjorie. “Soon after that she was invited to join
the Silver Pen. Leila has often spoken of what fine
girls some of the seniors were that year. She belongs
to the Silver Pen, too. She was invited to
join in her soph year.”
</p>
<p>
“Portia belongs,” returned Robin. “She is the
only one of our crowd who made it. The others of
us incline more toward music, I suppose. Phil is
thinking of founding a musical sorority. That
would be an innovation at Hamilton.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
Full of the new project of producing Katherine’s
play, Marjorie and Robin could not resist going
over to Randolph House that evening to see Kathie
and ask her permission to their plan. At first she
demurred. Finally she went to the trouble of hunting
for it in the bottom of her trunk so that Robin
might read it. The fact that the two girls desired
it as a money-maker for their worthy undertaking
carried weight with her. She gave her consent, her
only objection having been that it was only “trash”
and not good enough for a production in a literary
sense.
</p>
<p>
When Marjorie opened her eyes the following
Wednesday, on a cold December morning, her first
thought was of her appointment that day. She half
dreaded consulting the Hall bulletin board for fear
of finding another disappointing letter from the
agent. None appeared. She met Robin at half-past
two that afternoon. They hailed a taxicab for
the town of Hamilton, arriving at Mr. Cutler’s
office a few minutes before three.
</p>
<p>
As they were a little early, they were obliged to
wait for the agent to finish the business he was
transacting with two men. Marjorie drew a long
expectant breath as the door to the street closed
finally on the agent’s masculine callers.
</p>
<p>
“Will you young ladies please come into my private
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
office?” he said, after greeting them in his courteous
fashion. He opened the door for them and
stood aside for them to enter.
</p>
<p>
The trio seated in the inner office, Mr. Cutler
faced the two seniors with an expression that
vaguely discomfited Marjorie. While she never
tried to read the faces of those with whom she came
into contact, she had a peculiar sense of divination
which rarely failed her. The agent’s features betrayed
no indication of having pleasant news to
offer them. On the contrary they were rather
tensely set.
</p>
<p>
“I am very sorry to tell you,” he began, and the
hearts of both girls sank, “that the properties which
you wished to buy have been sold.” He jerked the
words out as though anxious to be done with the
disheartening information.
</p>
<p>
“Sold?” came the questioning chorus. Marjorie
and Robin stared at Mr. Cutler, then at each other.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Let me explain. When I wrote you, Miss
Dean, and made the appointment for today, I did
not know this. The properties were unsold when
Mr. Saxe, the owner, went to Chicago. In fact,
there had been no demand for them. The surprising
part of the affair is that the purchaser, on learning
that Mr. Saxe was in Chicago, went there to
see him. I did not furnish the address nor the information
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
concerning these properties. The sale
was conducted entirely away from me. The purchaser
must have wanted them very much. Mr.
Saxe was offered sixty thousand dollars for them.
Naturally he accepted, at once.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Sixty thousand dollars!</em>” exclaimed Robin in a
wondering tone. “That is a great deal more than
we could have paid.”
</p>
<p>
“I asked him what his own price would have
been,” continued Mr. Cutler. “He put it at forty
thousand dollars. Not far, you see, from my estimate.
They were purchased by a young woman, a
Miss Cairns, I believe her name was. She may have
been acting as agent for a private party. I don’t
know. It is rather a mystery to me—the whole
transaction. I was sorry for myself as well,” he
added whimsically. “It lost me a good fat commission.”
</p>
<p>
Neither Marjorie nor Robin said a word. It had
taken not more than an instant’s reckoning to decide
that “Miss Cairns” must be Leslie Cairns, ex-student
of Hamilton College. They knew she had been
staying in the town of Hamilton. They knew of
no other Miss Cairns.
</p>
<p>
“She must have known we wanted them!” Robin
cried out resentfully, forgetting for a second the
agent’s presence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did I understand you to say—” Mr. Cutler
stopped. He did not in the least understand Robin’s
remark.
</p>
<p>
“Then there is no use in our wasting your time,
Mr. Cutler,” Marjorie said, rising. “We are disappointed,
of course. We must look about us for
another site. That’s all. When we find one we
will come to you and have you make the inquiries
about it. We shall build our dormitory somewhere
in the neighborhood of the campus, some day.” She
flashed the agent a dauntless little smile.
</p>
<p>
“It is too bad; too bad,” he repeated. “I was
greatly interested in your plan. Do either of you,
by chance, know this Miss Cairns? The name is
unfamiliar to me as of this town.”
</p>
<p>
“We know of her. We do not know her personally.
She is a very rich woman, in her own right,
I have been told.” It was Robin who now made
answer.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Saxe said she paid cash for the properties,”
nodded the agent.
</p>
<p>
“So far as we are concerned, we could have paid
the price in cash of sixty thousand dollars. One of
our sorority members had offered to finance us. We
were to pay the debt to her at leisure. We felt it
not right to tax the students-to-come, at Hamilton,
with too heavy a burden of debt. We are in our
senior year and just starting this movement. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
shall appoint certain students to replace us in this
work when we have been graduated from Hamilton.
They in turn will choose their successors.” Marjorie
took the trouble to make this explanation
because of Mr. Cutler’s genuine interest in their
venture.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it is a noble ambition,” praised the agent.
“I will remember your need and look about me for
a suitable site for your dormitory. One never
knows what may develop. Now if you could buy
that open strip of ground belonging to the Carden
estate, it would be ideal for your purpose. The
Cardens, those left of the family, are in Europe
most of the time. They might decide suddenly to
sell their estate. I’ll keep you in mind,” he assured.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think of that?” were Robin’s first
words, spoken out of earshot of the agent.
</p>
<p>
“What do <em>you</em> think?” countered Marjorie. Her
tones bordered on bitterness. She was disturbed
far more than she had shown while in the office.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I said in there.” Robin indicated the
office with a backward movement of her head. “She
knew we wanted them and bought them on purpose
to thwart us. She has been in Hamilton since last
summer. How did she find out our plan, I wonder?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a question hard to answer. She must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
have heard something concerning it last year after
our show. It wasn’t what one could call a secret.
I mean the talk of building a dormitory. What
seems queer to me is this. The moment we got in
touch with Mr. Cutler, Miss Cairns hurried to Chicago
to head off this Mr. Saxe before we could see
him. We know Mr. Cutler did not tell her of us.
He said he had never met her. She has heard
something about it this fall.”
</p>
<p>
“Then she must be friendly and in communication
with certain students on the campus,” was
Robin’s conjecture.
</p>
<p>
“Undoubtedly.” Marjorie did not mention what
she had observed on her way to mail the letter
before the Thanksgiving vacation. It was of no
particular use, she reflected. The properties were
gone, the subject of them and their present owner
might better be entirely dismissed.
</p>
<p>
“Hateful old snake!” was Robin’s wrathful opinion
of Leslie Cairns. “The idea of her coming back
and living near the college after the disgrace of having
been expelled!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to make the best of it. It needn’t
hinder us from going on and giving our play. The
more money we earn, the more of our own we’ll
have when we find a site. Never say die, Robin.
That is the only way to do.” Marjorie was recovering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
from the damper she had lately received. “It
will all come out for the best. Remember what I
say, and see if it doesn’t. Some day we may be very
glad we didn’t get those properties. That is poor
consolation just now, I know.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m not cast into the depths,” Robin replied
in a lighter tone. “Nothing worth while is ever
gained without a struggle. Leslie Cairns may find
one of these days that she’d far rather have her
sixty thousand dollars back than be the owner of
those properties. I only hope she does.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>CHAPTER XIX—AN UNRELENTING ENEMY</h2>
<p>
At a meeting of the Nineteen Travelers in
Robin’s room, a howl of indignation went up over
the loss of the desired real estate. Discussion grew
apace when Leslie Cairns’ part in the transaction
was revealed. More than one girl among them
named Elizabeth Walbert as the source from which
Leslie had received information of the intended
movement toward erecting a dormitory. Marjorie
soon learned that she was not the only one who had
seen the two girls driving together.
</p>
<p>
This grave set-back only served to make the new
sorority more determined to carry out their project.
Marjorie having brought Kathie’s play with her, she
invited Leila to read it to the company. It was
received with acclamation. Before the Travelers
separated that evening, the parts had all been assigned.
Lucy had volunteered the typing of each
part during the evenings. She was sure that President
Matthews would not object to her use of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
typewriting machine in his home office. With rehearsals
under way at once, they hoped to give a
performance of the play soon after New Years.
Leila, Vera and Helen offered to go to the attic of
Wayland Hall and inspect the chest of costumes.
Vera laughingly announced herself as wardrobe
mistress. Leila accepted the post of stage manager
and threatened to be “a bully of some bad manners
and a roaring voice, if you show yourselves too
stupid.”
</p>
<p>
The Saturday succeeding Marjorie’s and Robin’s
disappointment sent Augusta Forbes to the heights
of stardom in the basket ball arena. She went into
the game fiercely resolving to outplay her team-mates
if she could. She was in the pink of condition
and played with more snap and precision than
Marjorie had ever seen her exhibit. She carried
her team, who did not distinguish themselves, on to
victory by her sensational plays. The freshmen won
over the sophomores by eight points. Gussie was
riotously lauded, as she deserved to be, and escorted
in triumph about the gymnasium by the usual admiring
mob of jubilant fans.
</p>
<p>
That evening she came to Marjorie’s door and
called her into the hall.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t stay a minute,” she commenced in evident
embarrassment. “I only want to say that I
couldn’t have played so well if it hadn’t been for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
you. I was losing my nerve until you made those
girls let me alone. One of them was really pleasant
to me today. The others haven’t been quite so
snippy as before. Thank you, until I can do something
splendid for you.”
</p>
<p>
She turned and fairly ran down the hall, leaving
Marjorie to look smilingly after her. She had not
had time to say a word in return for the impulsive
little recognition of her own worth.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you invite your company inside the
room instead of whispering to them in the hall?”
demanded Jerry with a ferocious scowl, as Marjorie
re-entered. “Once I was your honored confidant.
Now I am—What am I? An idiot, let us
say, for studying Political Science. It’s werry dry
and werry hard, Bean.”
</p>
<p>
“You are still my honored confidant. I never
considered you an idiot, and I loathe Political Science.
I wasn’t whispering outside the door, though.
I was talking to <em>l’enfant angelique</em>, suppose we call
her. She came to tell me that the other girls on
the team are minding their own affairs as they
should.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m amazed,” Jerry retorted genially. “Gloomy
Gus has certainly arrived. She was a whirlwind
today. Without her the freshies would not have
whipped the sophs. She’s agile, and has a good eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
for the basket. She landed some beauties this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie seconded this opinion. After a further
remark or two, Jerry turned her attention to the
despised intricacies of Political Science. Marjorie
made a valiant effort to study, but her mind roved
to her personal affairs. She finally took paper and
pencil and began to jot down the various things she
must do before going home for the Christmas holidays.
</p>
<p>
Paramount among them was a visit she must
make to Miss Susanna. The nine girls whom the
old lady had taken into her liking had already
ordered their tribute of flowers to be sent to her
on the day before Christmas. Marjorie always felt
rather timid about going to Hamilton Arms without
a special invitation. She had done so once or
twice that fall, as Miss Susanna had invited her to
come to the Arms at any time. She finally decided
to write her eccentric friend a note, asking permission
to spend a part of the next Sunday afternoon
with her. That would really be the only free time
she would have before Christmas. College would
close the following Thursday for the Yuletide holidays.
</p>
<p>
In the light of after events Marjorie looked back
on that particular Sunday afternoon as having been,
the most perfect visit she had ever made Miss Susanna.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
The old lady unbent conversationally to a
marked degree. She related incidents concerning
her life at Hamilton Arms, and also that of her distinguished
uncle, Brooke Hamilton, which, ordinarily,
would have remained obstinately locked behind
her stubborn lips.
</p>
<p>
Listening to Marjorie’s account of the recent failure
of the Nineteen Travelers to secure the site for
the proposed dormitory, Miss Susanna waxed quite
indignant over the manner in which the loss had
been effected.
</p>
<p>
“Too bad that man Cutler didn’t have John
Saxe’s address,” she said tersely. “I know John
very well. I remember him as a youngster in kilts.
I have been told that Cutler is an honorable gentleman.
That’s saying a good deal for a real estate
agent in these days of trickery.”
</p>
<p>
“He spoke of that piece of ground beyond those
two blocks of houses which belongs to the Carden
estate. He said the Cardens might decide to sell it
some day.” Marjorie spoke with the unfailing
optimism of youth.
</p>
<p>
“Not to anyone connected with Hamilton College.”
Miss Susanna’s face had set harshly at mention
of the name Carden. “Alec Carden was the man
I had trouble with that wound up my interest in
Hamilton College. He is dead now. He had two
sons, both married and the heads of families. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
of them lives at Carden Hedge, off and on. The
other is a financier in New York, I believe. They
were always a hard, tricky, dishonorable set. But
enough of them. Cutler didn’t say who owned that
block of houses below the one you lost, did he?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,” Marjorie replied after brief reflection.
“I can’t recall that he said more than that
they were not for sale.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, they are not for sale!” exclaimed Miss
Hamilton. “Those houses belong to me. Uncle
Brooke once owned the other block. He sold it to
John Saxe’s father.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we need never hope to build our dormitory
where your houses now stand.” Marjorie could not
resist saying this. She smiled, looking her hostess
squarely in the eyes as she uttered the pointed remark.
</p>
<p>
It appeared to amuse Miss Susanna immensely.
She laughed and said: “You are a straightforward
child, aren’t you? To please you I would be glad
to part with those properties for a small sum. I
can’t consider the situation from that standpoint,
unfortunately. I am done with Hamilton College.
That settles the matter. Suppose we talk about
something else.”
</p>
<p>
Quite accustomed to the old lady’s moods, Marjorie
obligingly complied with the preemptory request.
Neither did she allow it to intrude upon her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
mind until she had left Miss Susanna that evening.
She carried with her a basket of be-ribboned packages
to be distributed among the eight girls of Miss
Susanna’s acquaintance. The old lady’s emphatic
order had been: “These are to be opened on Christmas
morning; not a minute before.”
</p>
<p>
As she hurried lightly along over the frozen
ground, Marjorie wondered mightily what dire
calamity had been precipitated to incur such implacable
hatred against Hamilton College as Miss Susanna
plainly harbored. She could never think of it
rather than sorrowfully. It seemed so sad, that,
after all the time and labor and love Brooke Hamilton
had lavished upon the college, one of his own
kin should be its most unrelenting enemy.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Miss Hamilton had rung for Jonas
and was repeating to him all that Marjorie had said
to her. Jonas occupied in her household the position
of manager, servitor and valued friend. He
was close to eighty years of age and had been at
Hamilton Arms even longer than had Miss Susanna.
He had, as a young man, served Brooke
Hamilton faithfully during the latter’s declining
years.
</p>
<p>
“By right, Jonas, I ought to turn over that property
to those energetic youngsters,” she asserted in
her quick, matter-of-fact fashion. “Their object is
really a worthy one.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are trying to carry on <em>his</em> work,” Jonas
rejoined solemnly. “He would have wanted it to
be so, Miss Susanna.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know it, Jonas; I know it.” There was
more than a shade of regret in the admission. “I
can’t overlook some things. The college doesn’t
deserve it from me; not after the way I was treated
by the Board. No; they can’t have it. If there
was any good way to get hold of that strip of open
ground of Cardens, I’d do it. Cutler could be
trusted to sell it to Marjorie, and her friend Robin,
without mentioning me in the transaction. I’d do
it only to please the child, though; only to please
her.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>CHAPTER XX—ON HAMILTON HIGHWAY</h2>
<p>
Rehearsals of “The Maid of Honor” had been
begun before the holiday vacation. Returned from
their fortnight’s recreation, it did not take the illustrious
cast long to pick up again in their parts.
Muriel, much to her amazement, had been chosen
for Berenice, the heroine. Jerry reveled in the part
of Piccato, the jester. Leila was to play the male
lead of Florenzo, an ambassador from the Spanish
Court. He falls desperately in love with Berenice,
who has been promised from childhood to Lord
Carstairs, an English nobleman, favored by Queen
Elizabeth for his harshly dominating personality.
Ronny was cast for Narita, a court dancer, who
finally aids Berenice to escape from England with
Florenzo, her courtier husband, whom she has
secretly married.
</p>
<p>
On account of her height and breadth of shoulder,
Augusta Forbes had been asked to take the part of
Lord Carstairs. For several days after Leila had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
requisitioned her services as an actor, she went
about with her head in the clouds. Her chums were
no less pleased over the honor that had fallen to
“Gus.” Neither had they been forgotten. The
play required a large number of extra persons for
courtiers, ladies in waiting, etc. The Bertram girls
were among the first invited to grace the stage in
these minor rôles.
</p>
<p>
Luckily for the managers of the performance, the
cedar chest in the attic furnished enough really gorgeous
court costumes to fit out the principal male
characters. This was due to the fact of the small
percentage of women in the Shakespearian dramas
for which the costumes had been originally fashioned.
As neither Leila, Vera, Helen nor Martha
Merrick were overburdened with subjects, they took
upon themselves the getting together of the costumes
for the feminine contingent.
</p>
<p>
On a Friday evening, the latter part of January,
“The Maid of Honor” was presented to an overflowing
house. The gymnasium had, as usual,
served as theatre on account of its seating capacity.
While the stage of Greek Hall was much better as
a stage, its auditorium would hold not more than
two hundred persons.
</p>
<p>
Actors, author and managers received enough
applause during the play, and enough adulation
afterward, to turn their youthful heads. Honors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
were so evenly divided among the principals it was
hard to say who deserved the most praise. Katherine,
as author, received, perhaps, the most admiring
tribute of them all.
</p>
<p>
Acting upon Jerry’s shrewd advice, two dollars
had been set as the price of admission with no reserved
seats. She had argued that two dollars was
less than persons of their means usually paid for
seats at a theatre. In order not to leave out the off-the-campus
girls, Ronny had counted them up and
bought tickets for them. These she commissioned
Anna Towne to distribute with the stern warning:
“Don’t one of your crowd dare stay away from our
play.”
</p>
<p>
The net receipts of the play amounted to eleven
hundred, forty dollars, which the gratified managers
banked with gleeful satisfaction. Immediately they
set to work on a new play, also by Kathie, entitled,
“The Wyshinge Welle,” a drama of the Saxons in
Ethelbert’s time. This was hailed with jubilation
by Leila, who was especially fond of the life of this
period of history. The latter part of February
would see its presentation. If the promoters of
drama at Hamilton found it did not interfere too
greatly with their studies, they planned to give two
more plays, a musical revue and a concert before the
closing of the college in June.
</p>
<p>
After the stir occasioned by “The Maid of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
Honor” had died out came a restful lull. January
vanished rapidly into the deep pocket of the year.
February arrived, sharp and blustering in its early
days; warm and full of frequent thaws toward its
close. Sunshine and absence of snow made it fine
weather for automobiling, and the students of Hamilton
were quick to take advantage of it.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of girls are out with their cars today,”
Marjorie observed to Jerry as she stood before the
mirror of her dressing table adjusting her hat. “I
almost wish I had one. Still, I don’t need it, and it
would be an extravagance for me. I wouldn’t have
a cent to give toward the dormitory. That’s why
Robin and some of the other Travelers won’t have
their cars here. The upkeep is so great. At home,
garage rent is not more than ten dollars a month.
The girls here pay from fifteen to twenty.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s because they are a college crowd. A
garage proprietor figures that a girl who can afford
to keep a car at Hamilton can afford to pay a good,
stiff garage rent,” declared Jerry shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“Correct, as usual, Jeremiah.” Marjorie turned
from the mirror and began drawing on her gloves.
</p>
<p>
“My head is level, Bean; extremely so. I suppose
you won’t be back before nine o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“About that time. What shall I say to Miss
Susanna for you?” It being Saturday afternoon,
Marjorie was on the point of setting out for Hamilton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
Arms. She had received a note from Miss
Susanna on the day previous inviting her to spend
the afternoon and take dinner at the Arms.
</p>
<p>
“Tell her to invite me next time,” modestly requested
Jerry. “Remind her that she hasn’t entertained
the crowd of us since before Christmas.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe I <em>will</em> tell her that, Jeremiah.” Marjorie
tipped her head to one side and regarded her
room-mate with apparent seriousness.
</p>
<p>
“If you do,” Jerry looked startled, “I’ll never
forgive you, Marjorie Dean.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I won’t tell her.” Marjorie’s sober face
relaxed into a teasing smile.
</p>
<p>
“Uh-h; I guess not,” Jerry smiled with her. “I
don’t know what I shall do this afternoon. Hunt up
Helen and make her take me to ride, maybe. Oh,
I forgot. Leila is going to West Hamilton. She
said she’d take me with her. I’m saved from my
own society.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish you were going with me.” Marjorie
paused regretfully, hand on the door knob.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry over me, as Danny Seabrooke loves
to say. Beat it.” Jerry waved a jesting hand at
Marjorie. “Shoo! Begone!”
</p>
<p>
Laughing, Marjorie went. As she left the college
gates behind her she was thrilled with the joy
of being alive on such a day. The clear skies, brilliant
sunshine and pleasant tang in the air inspired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
joy of living. Once on the highway, several girls
driving their cars called out to her, asking her to
ride. To each invitation she smilingly said “No.”
In the first place she could not very well ask a student
she might ride with to drop her at Hamilton
Arms. In the second place she infinitely preferred
to walk.
</p>
<p>
“It is such a fine day I thought you might like to
take a walk with me to see my head gardener,” Miss
Hamilton proposed shortly after Marjorie’s arrival.
“He fell on the ice not long ago and broke his arm.
I am going to take him a basket of fruit and dainties.
I am not fond of making calls, but I always
try to look after my people when they have sickness
or are in distress.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d love to go with you,” Marjorie heartily assured.
“I’ll carry the basket in memory of one
other day when I carried a basket for you.”
</p>
<p>
“A very fortunate day it was for me.” Miss
Susanna smiled brightly upon the pretty senior.
Her affection for Marjorie was the brightest spot
in her secluded life.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t avoid taking the highway for some distance,”
deplored the old lady as they walked down
the drive toward the entrance gates. “My gardener
lives not far from it, but almost half a mile from
here. There is a gardener’s house on the estate,
but he owns his home and prefers to live there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
This is just the kind of day for your Hamilton girls
to be filling the highway with their automobiles. It
is taking one’s life into one’s hands to venture along
the road when they and their cars are out in numbers.”
</p>
<p>
There was distinct aggressiveness in the speech.
Miss Hamilton cherished a rooted antipathy for
automobiles. She still kept in the Arms stable a
pair of thoroughbred coach horses for her own use.
Nothing could tempt her to ride in a motor car.
</p>
<p>
From Hamilton Arms to the adjoining estate the
pike was broad, with wide level footpaths on each
side. They could travel this portion of it without
fear of accident from passing automobiles. A gradual
curve in the road at the beginning of the next
estate and it narrowed, continuing for two hundred
yards or more between two slight elevations. It
was the only “tricky” stretch of the highway, as
Leila had often remarked when driving over it.
</p>
<p>
The top of these elevations formed footpaths
only wide enough to permit the passing of persons,
single file. The February thaw had left them too
muddy to be used by pedestrians. It was a case of
either take to the pike itself or walk in the mud.
</p>
<p>
“A nice state of affairs!” Miss Susanna exclaimed,
her eyes snapping. “This is the way those
good-for-nothing Cardens left their part of the
highway. These banks should be leveled even with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
the roadbed. Then they would be fit to walk on.
Catch the Cardens spending any money for the
good of the public! Compare the appearance of
their estate with that of Hamilton Arms! Quite a
difference, isn’t there?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say so.” Interested in what Miss Susanna
was saying, Marjorie had relaxed for a moment
her vigilant watch on the road. She now
gazed critically at the wide, but not specially ornamental
grounds surrounding the colonial residence
which housed the hated Cardens when at home.
She saw clearly the inferiority of this estate as
compared to the dignity of ever-beautiful Hamilton
Arms.
</p>
<p>
A sharp little shout of alarm, and her attention
leaped to the road again. Around the curve, coming
toward them, a car had dashed at full speed.
Miss Susanna had cried out as she attempted to
dodge it. So abruptly had it appeared around the
curve she had not seen it until it was directly upon
her. The driver lacked the skill to turn the car aside
quickly enough to avert the calamity. Marjorie
added her cry of horror to Miss Hamilton’s. Before
she could drag her elderly friend out of danger, she
saw her apparently flung to one side. The devastating
motor car gave a wicked lurch and whizzed on.
</p>
<p>
Bewildered by the suddenness of the accident,
Marjorie stared unbelievingly when she next beheld
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
Miss Susanna not only move but raise herself from
the ground to a sitting posture. Sight of this apparent
miracle galvanized her into action. She sprang
to Miss Hamilton calling out:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Susanna, I’m so thankful you weren’t
run over. Tell me where you are hurt. I saw the
car fling you and——”
</p>
<p>
“The car didn’t touch me. I made a leap and fell
down just beyond it by not more than an inch or
two. My foot slipped in the soft mud. I am all
right. Help me up, child.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie had not attempted to raise the old lady
to her feet before ascertaining whether she were
able to stand. She now lifted her up with her
grateful, young strength, exclaiming indignant sympathy
over the muddy condition of Miss Hamilton’s
long coat of fine black broadcloth.
</p>
<p>
“Can you walk, Miss Susanna, or do you feel too
much shaken? Perhaps you ought to stand still
for a few minutes until you recover from the shock.
Plenty of taxicabs from the station or the taxi stand
below the campus pass here. I could hail one for
you if you would ride in it to the gardener’s house.”
</p>
<p>
“No, not for me,” refused the old lady with
sharp decision. “I shall turn back and go home. I
will send Jonas with the basket this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Take my arm. I can carry the basket with my
other hand.” As she talked Marjorie had busied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
herself in brushing off what she could of the mud
from the old lady’s coat. Miss Susanna’s hat was
still jammed over one eye. Her small, sturdy hands
were plastered with sticky mud. “Let me straighten
your hat. There! Now hold out your hands.”
Marjorie wiped them with her own handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
“Such a catastrophe,” scolded Miss Hamilton,
“and at my age! And all on account of a reckless
girl driver! I think I had better take your arm,
Marjorie. Can you manage to support me and
carry that basket, too?”
</p>
<p>
Assuring Miss Hamilton that she could, the two
slowly retraced their steps. A reaction soon setting
in, Miss Susanna became silent for a time. Marjorie
said nothing, fearing conversation might prove
an undue strain upon the victim of the accident.
</p>
<p>
“The least that young savage could have done
was to come back and see if there were any casualties,”
Miss Hamilton burst forth abruptly as they
entered the gateway of the Arms. She had now
sufficiently recovered from the shock to feel belligerent
toward the culprit. “A Hamilton girl, I suppose.
Did you recognize her, Marjorie?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I know who she is,” Marjorie replied
reluctantly.
</p>
<p>
“Very good. I shall report her to President
Matthews,” announced Miss Susanna, wagging her
head. “You are to tell me her name, or, better still,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
you and I will go together to his office and report
her.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie felt consternation rise within her. The
last thing in the world she wished to do was to go
to President Matthews’ office on such an errand,
even with Miss Susanna. Quick as a flash came the
reminder of the president’s threat to ban automobiles
at Hamilton, made at the time of the accident
to Katherine Langly.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Susanna,” she began impulsively, hardly
knowing how to speak her mind without giving
offense, “I know that girl who nearly ran you down
deserves to be reported. She has the reputation of
being a poor driver, and a very reckless one. Most
of the Hamilton girls who drive cars are careful.
Two years ago, Miss Cairns, the one who bought
the properties from us, ran down Katherine. She
was ill two weeks from the shock. She just missed
having her spine permanently injured. She did not
report Miss Cairns to President Matthews but——”
</p>
<p>
“And you think because Katherine was simpleton
enough to allow a murderous act like that to go unpunished
that I ought to do likewise,” supplied Miss
Susanna in a whip-like tone of anger which Marjorie
had never before heard her use. “You are——”
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon, Miss Susanna, I did not
mean——” Marjorie re-commenced in a distressed
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“Listen to me.” The irate old lady held up her
hand by way of command. “You are talking utter
nonsense.” The last of the Hamiltons was not
accustomed to being crossed. Shaken by her fall, she
was now in a highly querulous state, common to
those over sixty. “Not report that young heathen—ridiculous!
This girl must be a friend of yours
whom you are trying to shield. Certainly I shall
report her. I hold it important to do so. You may
know how important I consider reporting her when
I propose going to your president myself. I—who
have not set foot on the campus for years. I find I
am not well enough to have you at the Arms to dinner
this evening. I will bid you good afternoon.
Set the basket on the steps.”
</p>
<p>
They had reached the broad flight of stone steps
leading to the veranda of the Arms as the offended
great-niece of Brooke Hamilton snapped out these
pithy statements.
</p>
<p>
“Good afternoon, Miss Susanna.” The piteous
light in Marjorie’s eyes changed to one of justly
wounded pride. Very gently she set the basket on
the top step and turned away. Her friendship with
the last of the Hamiltons had terminated as abruptly
as it had begun.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>CHAPTER XXI—MISUNDERSTOOD</h2>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake what brought you home in
such a hurry?” Jerry came breezily into the room
just before six o’clock to find Marjorie sitting by a
window. In her hand was an open book. Her eyes
were not fixed upon it. They looked absently out
upon the brown sweep of campus. There was a
pathetic droop to her red lips which Jerry did not
miss.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Bean; dearie dearest Bean?”
she commiserated, going up to Marjorie and dropping
her hands sympathetically upon her chum’s
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“I—oh, Jeremiah, I just feel sad—that’s all.”
Marjorie’s chin quivered suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
She had turned away from Miss Susanna feeling
like a child who was being sent home for bad
behavior. She had been entirely misunderstood.
She had quickly realized the utter futility of attempting
to make herself clear under the circumstances.
So she had proudly accepted her dismissal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tell your old friend, Jeremiah, all about it,”
coaxed Jerry. She took her hands from Marjorie’s
shoulders and employed them in drawing up a chair.
Placing it directly opposite Marjorie she sat down,
leaned far forward and beamed on her vis-a-vis
with an ingratiating show of white teeth.
</p>
<p>
The ghost of a smile reluctantly crept to Marjorie’s
lips. That particular expression of Jerry’s
was irresistible. She reached out and gratefully
patted Jerry’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks for the pat.” Jerry continued to beam.
“Next we will hear your sad story. I believe you
have been crying, Marjorie Dean!” she accused in
sudden concern. “Tell me what and who made you
cry and I will go forth on the war path!”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t, this time. It—was Miss Susanna.”
Marjorie swallowed the rising lump in her throat
and steadied her voice. “She misunderstood me.
I can never go to Hamilton Arms again.”
</p>
<p>
“Good night! That <em>is</em> tough luck! Poor Marjorie;
no wonder you feel all broken up.”
</p>
<p>
Inspirited by Jerry’s warm sympathy, Marjorie
related, with an occasional catch in her voice, the
afternoon’s direful events.
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t going to ask Miss Susanna not to report
Miss Walbert,” Marjorie sorrowfully explained.
“I was going to ask her please not to make it any
harder for the other girls who have cars here than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
she could help. I spoke of Kathie’s accident because
I wished her to know what President Matthews had
said about banning automobiles at Hamilton. I was
going to tell her that someone else reported Miss
Cairns for running down Kathie when she stopped
me. She thought I was holding Kathie up to her as
a glowing example, and I never meant it that way,”
Marjorie mournfully concluded.
</p>
<p>
“She had no business to cut you off without a
hearing,” Jerry criticized with some resentment.
“I always had an idea she was like that. Well, the
gun-powder mine didn’t blow up as soon as I
thought it would. This is the first squabble you
two have had. She will get over it. She loves you
dearly. After she descends from her pinnacle of
wrath she will probably think things over and write
you a note.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie shook her head with somber positiveness.
“No, she won’t. She considers me in the
wrong. She didn’t even give me time to tell her
Miss Walbert’s name. I should have known better
than to say a word so soon after the accident. She
was shaken and generally upset. I spoke before
I thought. Miss Susanna seems more like one of
us than an old lady. I am always forgetting her
age. She is so brisk and energetic.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe she will go to Doctor Matthews.
She may write him a note. I doubt it, though.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think she will go to see him. She was so very
angry. It is my duty to write her a note and give
her Miss Walbert’s name. She asked me for it, and
she has a right to it.” Marjorie fell silent with the
contemplation of this idea.
</p>
<p>
“Who was with the would-be-murderess of innocent
pedestrians?” Jerry questioned sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
“A freshman from Alston Terrace,” Marjorie answered.
“I never saw her with Miss Walbert before.
I have seen her once or twice with Miss
Forbes.”
</p>
<p>
“She must be fond of extremes,” commented
Jerry. “Miss Run-’em-down Walbert has a horrible
reputation on the campus as a driver. I wish Doctor
Matthews would rise up in his might and ban
her as a no-good motorist and nuisance. The Hamiltonites
would tender him a laurel wreath, or a diamond
medal, or something quite nice,” finished
Jerry with a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
“If it were she alone who would be punished, I
shouldn’t care. I told Miss Susanna she deserved
to be reported. It was the innocent I was thinking
of; not the guilty. Cars are a convenience as well
as a pleasure when they are in the hands of girls like
Leila, Vera, Helen and some others. I shall write
a note to Miss Susanna and try to explain myself.
I can’t bear to be misjudged by her. Oh, dear! It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
is just one more hard thing to do that I don’t like
to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t write it tonight then,” advised Jerry. “You
are still too close to your trouble. Wait a day or
two before you write.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose I’d better,” Marjorie listlessly agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; you had.” Jerry adopted a purposely lugubrious
tone.
</p>
<p>
“Stop making fun of my sorrow.” Marjorie
could not resist a faint giggle at Jerry’s ridiculous
imitation of herself.
</p>
<p>
“Aha! That’s more like it. Now I propose we
shut up shop and go to Baretti’s for dinner. I’ve
been hungrily thinking of fried chicken and hot waffles
with maple syrup this P. M. They aren’t going
to have ’em here for dinner, either. There’s to be
beefsteak <em>en casserole</em>, which is all very nice, but
my mind is on chicken and waffles.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’d rather have chicken, too. I’m beginning
to be hungry in spite of my troubles.” Marjorie
rose from her seat near the window. “You’re
a true comforter, Jeremiah. Wait until I bathe my
face and smooth my hair and I’ll go anywhere you
say.”
</p>
<p>
“Fine!” returned Jerry cheerily. “It will be the
first time you and I ever went out alone to dine.
The girls have always been with us. Nowadays
Ronny is so popular I hardly catch a glimpse of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
on the campus. But the five little old Lookouts always
congregate at ten-fifteen every night. That
helps.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry referred to a custom begun only that year.
The great popularity of the five girls, which had
been steadily increasing since their freshman year,
served to separate them during their leisure hours
from each and one another. Muriel had proposed
they gather every night at ten-fifteen for a brief
chat before retiring.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Baretti’s, Marjorie’s pensive mood
still clung to her. Jerry made no direct effort to
dispel it. She knew it would have to wear away of
its own accord. Baretti’s delicious fried chicken
and extra crisp waffles was a favorite order with
the Hamilton students. Engaged presently in eating
this palatable fare, Marjorie started in sudden
surprise at an unfamiliar voice at her elbow. She
glanced up from her plate to meet the eyes of the
freshman she had seen that afternoon in Elizabeth
Walbert’s car.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t think me intrusive, Miss Dean,”
the freshman was saying. “I noticed you when
you came in and I was so anxious to learn whether
the woman with you today on the pike was injured
by Miss Walbert’s car. I begged her to turn around
and go back, but she wouldn’t. She said she was
sure that she hadn’t come within several feet of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
woman. It looked to me as though she were almost
under the wheels. Of course, I only caught a
glimpse of both of you, so I couldn’t really judge
exactly what happened.”
</p>
<p>
The girl paused, looking signally embarrassed as
she met the clear steady gaze of Marjorie’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“The woman was not run over. In trying to get
out of the car’s way she fell. As she is an old lady,
she was considerably jarred by the fall. Her coat
was badly splashed with mud.” Marjorie delivered
the information with impersonal courtesy.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to hear she wasn’t run over,” sighed
the other girl, looking genuine relief. “Was—was
she a relative of yours?”
</p>
<p>
“No; a friend.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope you don’t hold me to blame in any way,
Miss Dean. It is the first time I ever rode in Miss
Walbert’s car, and it will be the last. I was waiting
for a taxicab in town and she came along and
offered to ride me back to the campus. I am Miss
Everest, a freshie. I don’t know what you think of
me. I am awfully concerned about your elderly
friend. Anyway, I feel better for having seen you
and cleared myself as best I can.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie could not overlook the evident honesty
of the apology. The half appealing expression in
the freshman’s eyes did not escape her notice.
</p>
<p>
“I do not blame you, in the least, Miss Everest,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
she said quickly. “You were not driving the car.
I blame Miss Walbert severely. Since coming to
Hamilton she has had a great deal of trouble over
her driving, for which she is entirely to blame. I
do not know what the outcome of this affair will
be for her. My friend is very angry and may take
it up with Doctor Matthews. I speak frankly. If
Miss Walbert receives a summons she may name
you as having been in her car when she so nearly
ran down my friend.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh-h-h!” The ejaculation breathed consternation.
“I shouldn’t like that. Still, I am not afraid.
I can only tell the truth.”
</p>
<p>
“Doctor Matthews is a very fine and just man.
If any such thing occurs he will not censure you for
Miss Walbert’s fault.” Marjorie smiled up brightly
into the half clouded face above her. In answer to
an imperative touch of one of Jerry’s feet against
hers, she said: “This is my room-mate and dear
friend, Miss Macy.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls bowed. Jerry affably invited the
freshman to join them at dessert. She was with
another freshman at a table farther down the room
and declined. She appeared highly gratified at such
cordiality on the part of the two seniors and left
them with glowing cheeks and happy eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Drop one acquaintance from Kill-’em-off Walbert’s
list,” observed Jerry as the freshman departed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
“That freshie is done with her for good and all.
Too bad our amateur motorist didn’t enlist for overseas
service in the late war. She would have done
great execution driving a tank. She’d have sent the
enemy fleeing in all directions.”
</p>
<p>
Marjorie could do no less than laugh at this far-fetched
conceit. “I thought I had best warn Miss
Everest of what she might expect,” she said, her
face sobering. “What I said about Miss Walbert
was deliberate. I mentioned Miss Susanna as my
friend and I may never have a chance to speak to
her again.” Marjorie added this with a kind of
sad bitterness.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, you will. Don’t be down-hearted, beautiful
Bean,” hopefully assured Jerry. “Write your
letter to your offended lady of the Arms and see
what happens. She can’t misunderstand you after
she reads it.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she won’t misunderstand me, but that
doesn’t mean she will be friendly with me or even
with you girls again. She detested girls until she
met us. She’ll probably think she was foolish ever
to bother with us. Even if she felt she had misjudged
me, she is such an odd, proud little person
she might not be able to bring herself to write me.
If she doesn’t answer my letter, then I shall never
write her again. I’ll understand that she did not
care to continue the friendship.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>CHAPTER XXII—A DISMAYED PLOTTER</h2>
<p>
The author of the mischief, Elizabeth Walbert,
was not concerning herself over what had occurred
on Saturday afternoon on Hamilton Highway.
She had not the remotest idea as to the identity of
the elderly woman she had come so nearly injuring.
She knew that Marjorie had been with the woman.
Very scornfully she had derided Miss Everest’s
worried conjectures as to who the woman might
be, or, if she had been badly injured.
</p>
<p>
“An old scrub woman or some sort of servant,
very likely,” she had airily said. “Don’t be a silly.
Those two had no business to be walking along the
middle of the pike. The pike is for <em>autos</em>, not
pedestrians.” She had utterly flouted the suggestion
that she go back and ascertain what had happened
as the result of her reckless dash around a
corner.
</p>
<p>
Afterward, when alone, she resolved not to
bother again with Jane Everest. She was just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
another of those stupid freshies who had no daring
or spirit in them. Elizabeth was at that very
moment sulking because she could not persuade certain
freshmen at Wayland Hall who had until recently
been her allies to waylay Augusta Forbes
some evening on the campus and give her the “good
scare” she had fondly planned. Gussie often spent
an evening at Acasia House with a freshman who
recited Greek in her section. The two girls were
wont to prepare the lesson together. Thus Gussie
never started for Wayland Hall much before ten
o’clock. Elizabeth had learned this fact from an
Acasia House freshie. Her idea had been this:
Half a dozen girls, headed by herself, were to dress
in sheets and glide out upon Augusta from a huge
clump of bushes which she must pass in taking the
most direct route from the one campus house to the
other. Gussie was then to be surrounded, hustled
to a neighboring tree and tied to it. The industrious
specters were then to leave her to free herself
as best she could. The deed was to be done on a
moonless night when the weather was not severely
cold.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose she can’t free herself?” one of the
freshmen had put to Elizabeth on hearing her plan.
“We wouldn’t dare leave her there all night. You
say you know she comes from Acasia House often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
at about ten. We’d not have time to come back and
untie her before the ten-thirty bell.”
</p>
<p>
“It wouldn’t hurt her to stay out there awhile if
it weren’t cold,” was the cruel response. “I would
slip down and out of the Hall about midnight,
creep up behind her and cut the rope with a very
sharp knife.”
</p>
<p>
“Until midnight!” had gasped one girl. “<em>No, sir</em>;
not for me. Besides, you might cut her hand in the
dark while trying to free her. You are crazy, Bess.
Give up such daring schemes. They’ll only get you
into trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“We might easily be seen, dressed in sheets,”
another had objected. “Remember it is winter and
there aren’t any leaves on those bushes.”
</p>
<p>
“That wouldn’t make any difference if the night
were dark. I see plainly you girls aren’t nervy
enough for a little fun that wouldn’t do the baby
elephant any harm. In fact it would be the best
thing that could happen to her. She has bragged a
lot of not being afraid of anything. Never mind.
I’ll think of some nice little plan, all by myself.”
</p>
<p>
This last icy assurance, delivered with a haughty
crest of her empty head had not impressed her hearers.
She had gone a step too far with them. From
then on they began to drop away from her.
</p>
<p>
Disgusted with their lack of support, she undertook
to interest certain juniors in her plan. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
dared not come out frankly with it. Her vague
allusions as to what might be done met with utter
defeat. Her classmates, such as had even voted for
her for the freshman presidency, knew her better
now. They tolerated her but disliked her.
</p>
<p>
Finding no one interested in her schemes for
revenge, she was none the less determined to haze
Gussie. On the Sunday afternoon following the
disaster to Miss Susanna, she called Leslie Cairns
on the telephone and asked her to go for a ride.
Leslie accepted the invitation cannily, stipulating
that they should use her roadster. She was to meet
Leslie in front of Baretti’s.
</p>
<p>
Since the first day of their meeting in the Ivy,
Elizabeth had not dared mention the subject of
Leslie’s expulsion from college. Leslie had talked
of it a little herself that day. Then she had put up
the bars. What Elizabeth burned to consult her on
was what she might do to haze Augusta.
</p>
<p>
Anxious to keep Leslie in a good humor, she
racked her brain for campus gossip that would interest
the ex-senior.
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead. Let’s hear the news from the knowledge
shop,” ordered Leslie as the roadster sped
south under her practical hands. “Then I have a bit
of news for you. Maybe you won’t like it for a
second or two. After you get used to it, you will.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it? You tell me first. My scraps of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
news can wait.” Eager curiosity animated the
junior’s vapid features.
</p>
<p>
“No; I’m anxious to hear what’s happened over
there.” Leslie made a backward movement of the
head in the direction of the college.
</p>
<p>
“All right.” Elizabeth gave in, slightly sulky.
Soon she forgot to sulk as she weirdly embellished
truth for her companion’s gratification.
</p>
<p>
Leslie listened, calmly sorting out in her own
mind the proportion of truth contained in the
other’s narrations.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot to tell you about yesterday,” Elizabeth
declared, when her budget of gossip was exhausted.
“I was out driving with a freshie who
has an awful crush on me and I nearly ran over
Bean and a scrub woman, or servant—anyway an
old fossil she was with. They were marching along
the middle of the pike near the Carden Estate. I
came around the corner pretty fast. I was on my
own side of the pike, though. I’m sure of that. I
know——”
</p>
<p>
A sudden deep scowl corrugated Leslie’s forehead.
“You are positive you didn’t hit either of
them, are you?” she asked in an odd, sharp voice.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not. Everest, the freshie, said I
knocked the old lady down. It scared the silly
goose. She grew quite panicky over it. I knew I
didn’t come within six feet of either of them. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
wanted me to go back. I was too wise to do that.”
</p>
<p>
“What did this woman look like?” again came
the tight, tense tones. “I suppose, though, you
couldn’t tell much about her.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I couldn’t. Evie said she was dressed in
black and small.”
</p>
<p>
“You should have gone back.” Leslie’s loose lips
tightened in displeasure. It was easy enough to
give advice which she herself had not followed on a
similar occasion. “For all you know that woman
may have been faculty. Bean’s on very good terms
with them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, pshaw! This woman looked old, from the
glimpse I caught of her—too old to be faculty.
She’d have nothing to report anyway. They had
no business on the pike in the very path of machines,
coming and going.”
</p>
<p>
“Bess, you don’t seem to have good sense.” Leslie
had grown caustic. “You <em>know</em> Matthews threatened
to ban cars when I ran down Langly. If you
are reported for this, you’re <em>done</em> with your buzz
wagon at Hamilton. So are all the other students.
Oh, this is too bad! And all because you are either
too stubborn or else too stupid to learn to drive!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand you, Leslie, and you will
kindly stop calling me stupid,” sputtered Elizabeth,
her face very red.
</p>
<p>
“You will understand in a minute. As it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
happens, your punk driving may have seriously interfered
with a business venture of mine. Since I left
college I have been looking about for a chance to go
into business for myself. One of my ventures is
to be a garage near Hamilton College.” Leslie
spoke rapidly and with displeased force. “Now I
chose to even my score with Bean at the same time.
That’s why I wanted you to find out about those
properties. I heard last year before I was fired
from college about a wonderful dormitory the little
prigs were going to try to build near the campus,
for the benefit of plebeian beggars who want to go
through college on nothing a year.
</p>
<p>
“I remembered it after I left Hamilton. That’s
why I came back and took up a residence here. I
made up my mind I’d find out the site they were
after and take it away from them. The woman I
am with is my chaperon, not my aunt. I tried to
get Alida and Lola interested in the affair, but
couldn’t. I knew you could help me, so I decided
to forget the past and be friends with you again.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you explain all this to me in the
beginning, instead of deceiving me so?” burst forth
Elizabeth rancorously.
</p>
<p>
“It had to be kept a dead secret. You would have
told it to someone, sure as fate. I’m telling you
now. That’s soon enough,” returned Leslie coolly.
“Now listen to the rest. I have bought those boarding-house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
properties west of the campus—the block
that contains the seven houses. I paid sixty thousand
dollars for them and I am going to have ’em
torn down and a mammoth garage put up there.
You see what will happen to my investment if cars
are banned at Hamilton.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, bother your old investment!” Elizabeth had
grown angrier as she listened to Leslie. “It will
never amount to a string of glass beads. Am I to
blame because people won’t keep out of the path of
my car?”
</p>
<p>
“The path of your car!” Leslie repeated with a
sarcastic snicker. She was equally incensed at her
companion’s disparagement of her business venture.
“Where is that wonderful path? All over the road,
I’ll say. The state ought to issue you a non-license
instead of a license.”
</p>
<p>
Thus began a quarrel which raged hotly for several
minutes. Elizabeth was furious at having been
deceived by Leslie. The latter was utterly out of
temper over the seeds of catastrophe to her plans
which the junior had sown. They were a long way
from Hamilton when the altercation began. In the
midst of it Leslie turned the roadster about and
started back over the route they had come. By the
time the campus wall appeared in sight a black
silence had fallen between them. Nor was it broken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
until Leslie brought her car to an even stop at the
eastern entrance.
</p>
<p>
“You may as well get out here,” she sullenly dictated.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry I didn’t have my own car. I needn’t have
troubled you then,” vituperated Elizabeth, as she
hastily bundled herself out of the roadster.
</p>
<p>
“A good thing for public safety you didn’t have
it,” Leslie sneered. “If my investment turns out
unprofitable, it will be <em>your</em> fault.”
</p>
<p>
With that she drove on, her brief connection with
Elizabeth Walbert at an end. At the height of her
anger, a cool ruthlessness behind it informed her
that the time had come to drop the junior irrevocably.
She no longer needed her services. If cars
should be banned at Hamilton College, as a result of
Elizabeth’s reckless blundering, she would know it
soon enough. Shrewd use of her eyes would
quickly furnish her with the information. She
laughed to herself as she recalled the junior’s rage.
</p>
<p>
The serious side of the situation returning, all
signs of mirth faded from her rugged face. The
investment she had made had been planned with a
view toward placating her father. Once she had
the garage ready for business she intended writing
him of what she had done. There was no large
garage near the college. Students owning cars were
obliged to place them wherever they could find a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
vacant space in the several garages between the college
and the town of Hamilton. A few students
even had been obliged that year, owing to lack of
accommodations, to leave their automobiles in town.
</p>
<p>
Leslie’s idea of building a large garage near the
campus would not have appealed to a present-day
business man. The expense for site, the outlay in
tearing down, in order to rebuild, not to mention
the cost of erecting the garage—these items would
have made the day of large profits too far distant.
Leslie, however, was not considering either expense
or profits. Her double aim was to even her score
with Marjorie Dean, at the same time impressing
her unforgiving father with her great business
ability.
</p>
<p>
Now disaster threatened, precipitated by the very
pawn she had used to further her own ends. She
could only hope that Elizabeth’s blundering had not
caused mishap. She was sure Marjorie would not
report the matter. What her companion might do
remained to be seen. It would depend entirely upon
the identity of the elderly woman in black.
</p>
<p>
While Elizabeth Walbert and Leslie Cairns were
engaged in altercation, Marjorie was trying to
frame a letter to the offended mistress of Hamilton
Arms. She was alone in her room, Jerry having
wisely decided to leave her in absolute quiet while
she composed the difficult message. She wrote and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
rewrote, tore into bits what she had written and
began again. What she set down seemed a poor
expression of her mind in the matter.
</p>
<p>
The shadows of late afternoon had begun to
lengthen when she finally sealed the product of her
painful industry and addressed the envelope to her
offended friend. Though her heart was heavy, her
mind was more at ease. Miss Susanna might ignore
her written explanation so far as acknowledging it
went. Nevertheless, Marjorie felt that she could
not ignore the truth it contained.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>CHAPTER XXIII—“GETTING EVEN”</h2>
<p>
Due to the unexpected quarrel which had sprung
up between herself and Leslie, Elizabeth had gained
no fruitful suggestions regarding ways and means
of hazing from Leslie Cairns. She told herself she
did not care. No doubt Leslie would have coolly
advised her to “drop it.” This the vengeful girl had
no intention of doing. Her spleen against Augusta
Forbes had grown to an extent which made her
determined to “even up” with the detested freshie,
no matter how great the risk of detection. She
firmly believed herself to be too clever to be detected.
</p>
<p>
The first days of a stormy March whistled and
shrieked across the campus before Elizabeth hit
upon a scheme which seemed within her scope. Fortune
appeared to favor her in that Augusta exchanged
sharp words with Alma Hurst and Ida
Weir, the two freshmen who made it hardest for
her on the basket ball team. The trouble occurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
between the halves of a practice game. Elizabeth
chanced to be standing near enough to the two, as
a spectator, to hear a part of it. It gave her an
excuse to seek out Alma and Ida that evening and
have a confidential talk with them. Both players
were bitter against Augusta, who had, as usual, been
valiantly standing up for her rights. Elizabeth’s
crafty insinuations, which grew soon to open denunciation
of Gussie, fell upon willing ears. Thereafter
the trio were to be found with their heads together
as they formulated their plot against independent
Gussie.
</p>
<p>
Continued stormy weather forced Elizabeth to
abandon the idea of tying Augusta to a tree on the
campus and leaving her there. It also meant too
great a hazard. Three of them could hardly manage
the tall, broad-shouldered freshie when it came
to a question of physical strength. She had tried to
coax a sufficient number of girls into her scheme
and had failed. She decided to resort to the method
she had earlier employed of doing some mischief to
Augusta’s room. Over and over the three plotters
discussed the subject, proposing this trick and that.
Many of the proposals were too hard for accomplishment
to be considered more than briefly. Every
now and then one or the other would hit upon something
that could be added to the list which they had
made up of depredations easy “to get away with.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p>
“The time has come to act,” were the words with
which Elizabeth greeted the two freshmen one afternoon.
They had met her by appointment in the
library. Neither lived at Wayland Hall. She had
cunningly warned them against coming there until
they should have “put over the great stunt.” Then
no suspicion could, later, be attached to them.
</p>
<p>
“Glad to hear it,” Alma Hurst said with a disagreeable
smile. “If ever I detested a girl I do that
overgrown, domineering freshie. You can’t make
me believe that she didn’t go to Miss Dean with a
great long string of yarns about us. Miss Dean
wrote me a <em>hateful</em> note. In it she claimed the sports
committee had been observing us for quite awhile.
I know they <em>hadn’t</em>. I wouldn’t believe <em>her</em> any
sooner than I would Miss Smarty Forbes.”
</p>
<p>
“Better not let any of Miss Dean’s friends hear
you say that.” Elizabeth arched her eye-brows with
a knowing air. “Her crowd think her perfection.
She is awfully influential on the campus. I never
tried to put anything over on her for fear of getting
into difficulties.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve heard she was a power here.” The accompanying
shrug denoted supreme indifference. “I’m
not likely to come within conversational range of
her crowd. She doesn’t approve of me, nor her
pals, either. Miss Forbes gets all the babying from
<em>them</em>. Can’t say I admire their taste.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth gave a contemptuous sniff. “Miss Dean
pretends to be very noble and talks a lot about observing
Hamilton traditions. She treated me abominably
the day I landed on the station platform, a
freshie.” For the twentieth time Elizabeth recited
her imaginary grievance. The tale was, as usual, a
far departure from truth. It impressed her listeners
because they wished to be impressed by it.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not surprised.” Alma was still smarting
from the merited rebuke Marjorie had delivered her
by letter. “She’s been <em>so</em> unfair toward us. Proffy
Leonard allows her to run basket ball. Speaking of
hazing—was she hazed two years ago? I heard so,
and that the girls who hazed her were expelled from
college. I heard they were seniors.”
</p>
<p>
“They were seniors,” nodded Elizabeth, “seventeen
of them. They weren’t found out until late
last year. If you are caught hazing a student, off
goes your head. We must be careful. No reason
why we shouldn’t get away with our plan, though.
This is what we’ll do and when we’ll do it. I
am——”
</p>
<p>
“Did Miss Dean know who hazed her? Who reported
the seventeen seniors?” demanded Ida Weir
with manifest uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what Miss Dean knew. One of
the hazers betrayed the others and left college.”
Elizabeth proceeded to paint Dulcie Vale’s treachery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
in lurid colors. “Don’t worry about being caught,”
she frowned, impatient at the interruption. “<em>I</em> know
how to manage matters. The girl who planned the
flivver that shut her crowd out of college thought
herself a wizard. She was far from being one.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t consider such a risky scheme for two
seconds if I weren’t bent on making things lively
for that big booby of a Miss Forbes.” Alma’s eyes
flashed vindictively. “Go ahead, Bess. We won’t
interrupt you again.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well.” Elizabeth accepted the apology as
her due. “To begin with, we will muss up her room
on the night of the next show Miss Dean’s crowd
give. I hear they are going to put on a concert
soon. They have made a lot of money with those
two plays they’ve already given. Catch them asking
any of us to take part,” she interpolated enviously.
“I wouldn’t if they <em>begged</em> me to be in one.
But that’s neither here nor there. The night they
give their old concert everybody from Wayland
Hall will be over at the gym attending it. We’ll
buy tickets for it. Supposedly, we’ll be there; only
we won’t. Who can prove that we were not there?
Not an easy matter? What?” Elizabeth intensely
admired this imitation of Leslie Cairns on her part.
</p>
<p>
“Fine!” exclaimed Alma. “Since we don’t room
at Wayland Hall, no one can possibly suspect us,
Ida.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“Suppose anyone happened to see us coming to
the Hall?” Ida proposed to regard the risk from
all points.
</p>
<p>
“No one will see you,” cut in Elizabeth pettishly.
“You will have to come over here after everyone
has started for the concert. I have a latch key that
fits the front door. I found it one day in the hall
near Remson’s office. I heard afterward, she had
lost her key, but I hung on to the one I found. I’ve
used it after ten-thirty several times. Maybe it
isn’t a convenience! You can let yourself into the
house with it and run upstairs in a flash. If one of
the maids happened to see you she wouldn’t pay any
attention to you, unless you came in too late. You’ll
have to strike a happy medium as to the time you
get here. Most of the girls will be gone from here
by a quarter to eight. You ought to arrive at ten
minutes of eight.”
</p>
<p>
“Easiest thing in the world,” Alma said confidently.
“No one would think twice about seeing
us. If they should it would only be to conclude we
had come over to the concert with some of the Wayland
Hall crowd. That key makes everything
lovely. We’ll be able to let ourselves in without a
bit of fuss.”
</p>
<p>
“Next I’ll tell you the programme.” Under pretense
of showing the two freshmen what, to a casual
observer, would have passed for notes made in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
library, Elizabeth carefully went over with them the
list of depredations to be carried out in Augusta’s
room.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she won’t look sick when she comes
from the concert and sees what has happened!” gleefully
predicted Alma. “It will serve that uppish
room-mate of hers right. I’ll see she doesn’t escape.
What about your room-mate, Bess? Can you keep
the stuff we shall use out of her sight entirely?”
</p>
<p>
“She never sees anything but her books,” was the
contemptuous reply. “Leave all that to me. I know
what I’m doing. Remember what I say. No one
will ever guess who upset baby’s room. It will go
down in the annals of Wayland Hall as an absolute
mystery.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>CHAPTER XXIV—VANDALISM</h2>
<p>
The March days came and went, cold and frost-bitten
for the most part, and still Marjorie’s letter
to Miss Susanna met with no reply. Each day Marjorie
wondered if she would be summoned to President
Matthews’ office as a result of a report lodged
with him by the last of the Hamiltons against Elizabeth
Walbert. Not that the doctor needed her testimony
to substantiate Miss Susanna’s complaint.
She had an idea the irate old lady might leave her
name out of it entirely. Should Miss Susanna mention
her as having been a witness to the mishap,
Doctor Matthews would no doubt insist on sending
for her privately. He could not fail to be interested
in the news that she had had an acquaintance of
some standing with Brooke Hamilton’s great-niece.
She thought this because of the talk she had once
had with him concerning Hamilton Arms and its
eccentric mistress.
</p>
<p>
The “Wyshinge Welle” had been received with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
great enthusiasm. At the earnest request of the
faculty it had been repeated a week from the night
of its first performance. The second audience was
composed of faculty and friends of the faculty residing
in the adjacent suburban towns who were
interested in matters germane to Hamilton College.
</p>
<p>
In writing the quaint play Katherine had shown
actual genius. So had Leila Harper in staging and
producing it. The Nineteen Travelers were delighted
with it and planned to pass it on, to become
a regular yearly performance at Hamilton. Phyllis
Moore had assisted Leila in the production of it, so
that she might be proficient in stage managing it
the next year. Both performances of the play added
twenty-four hundred dollars to the Fund.
</p>
<p>
With spring on the threshold, Marjorie and
Robin announced their concert as next on the list of
entertainments. It was to be given the latter part of
April. The latter part of May would come the
musical revue to end their season. They calculated
that the year’s efforts would net them over five
thousand dollars. Phyllis and her orchestra would
be vital to the concert. So would Robin, Blanche
Scott and half a dozen students with exceptionally
fine voices. Marjorie wished Ronny to give one
dance, an exquisite interpretation called “The Return
of Spring.” Marjorie had seen her dance it
in private several times. It was her favorite of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
Ronny’s many wonderful interpretations. Robin
had arranged an off-stage chorus of voices to go
with it which rendered it even more beautiful.
</p>
<p>
Whenever Marjorie stopped to think of the yawning
gap between herself and Miss Hamilton it made
her sad. She tried to keep it out of her thoughts
as much as possible. Like a good soldier she
marched on toward the end of her hike through the
Country of College, face front, steps firm and
steady. The eight girls who had been entertained
at the Arms never mentioned Miss Susanna’s name
to her. She had told them all in confidence what
had occurred, feeling it was their right to know of
the estrangement.
</p>
<p>
She had been strongly tempted to send her
offended friend tickets for the play recently given.
She had refrained from doing so, fearing lest the
old lady would return them, plus a check for the
sum they amounted to. As the date of the concert
approached, she wished often that Miss Susanna
would attend it. She was an ardent lover of
music, and Marjorie was very proud of the programme.
It was highly representative of the best
in music. She knew her wish to be entirely in vain.
Even if Miss Susanna and she were on good terms,
the last of the Hamiltons would not honor the
campus with her presence.
</p>
<p>
The weather turning warm and balmy, even for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
April, the night of the concert saw the fast-reviving
campus aflutter with delicate evening finery.
The students were only too glad of an opportunity
to display the pretty new evening frocks most of
them had worn for the first time at home during
the Easter holidays.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon preceding the concert a wholesale
laying out of evening frills went on at Wayland
Hall. Elizabeth Walbert’s outfit for the evening
did not consist of dainty wearing apparel. A
stroke of sheer good luck had brought Miss Schultz
a dinner invitation to the home of Professor Wenderblatt.
The professor was giving a dinner to
fourteen guests prior to the concert. Miss Schultz
had dressed and departed before six o’clock, leaving
Elizabeth a free hand from then on.
</p>
<p>
The moment the dining room opened she hastened
in to dinner, ate hurriedly and rushed upstairs
again. The motley outfit she produced from her
dress closet and carefully set out on the floor of her
room would have puzzled anyone excepting herself.
She knew the precise use of each article. She was
also prepared if she found Gussie’s door locked.
She had long since learned that the key to her door
would unlock that of Gussie’s.
</p>
<p>
Half-past seven saw Wayland Hall practically
emptied of its residents. There were no reserved
seats save those on the front row down stairs, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
had been given over to the faculty. It was a case
of the earlier the arrival the better the seat. The
gymnasium doors opened at seven-fifteen.
</p>
<p>
Quarter to eight saw two dark forms emerge
from behind a clump of fast-greening bushes on
the lawn of Wayland Hall. Alma and Ida had
arrived at twenty minutes to eight and had sought
cover until they were assured of a clear coast.
After five minutes’ wait, during which time no one
left the Hall, they decided it was safe to proceed on
their way.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry and open the door,” whispered Ida in an
agony of suspense as Alma fumbled in a small purse
for the key. “This porch light is a dead give-away.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah-h-h!” Alma drew a soft breath of satisfaction
as the key turned smoothly in the lock.
</p>
<p>
First glance showing them an empty hall, they
fled up the stairs like true conspirators. Reaching
the second floor they made for a door at near the
south end. Ere they were half way to it it opened.
Quick as a flash they dodged into it.
</p>
<p>
Three-quarters of an hour later a young woman
in evening frock and cape stepped serenely out on
the veranda of the Hall. She steered a straight
course for the gymnasium. At intervals of ten minutes
apart two more young women emerged from
the Hall and hurried gymnasiumward. Each one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
the trio was securely certain she had not been observed.
</p>
<p>
The concert came to an end at ten o’clock. It
had been as well received as had the other entertainments
of the season under the expert management
of the good little firm of “Page &amp; Dean.” The
usual pleasant hum of enthusiastic voices, uttering
remarks congratulatory to those who had taken part,
was heard as the large audience streamed out of
the gym’s wide doorway and into the star-studded
night.
</p>
<p>
The Bertram freshies had attended in a body,
with the exception of Charlotte Robbins. She had
been a proud participant in the concert. Possessed
of a full, sweet contralto voice, she had been asked
to contribute a solo. Her chums were justly elated
over “Charlie’s rise.” Augusta had planned a dinner
to be given in her honor at Baretti’s the next
evening.
</p>
<p>
“Little old Bertram hasn’t done so badly this
year,” exulted Flossie Hart as the merry crowd of
chums mounted the steps of the Hall. “Gus made
the team. We’ve all had small parts in the two
plays the Travelers have given. Now Charlie has
had her inning.”
</p>
<p>
“You sang beautifully, Charlotte, truly you did,”
praised Gussie warmly. “Honestly, girls, I’m simply
crazy over Marjorie Dean. She is the sweetest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
girl I ever knew. I want to say it now because I
once misjudged her so.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew you’d see it some day, Gus,” broke in
Calista Wilmot. “I’m as glad as you that we have
all amounted to a little as freshies. It is nice to be
noticed, rather than have to be always in the background.”
</p>
<p>
It was in this happy frame of mind that Gussie
and her companions climbed the stairs to their
room.
</p>
<p>
The mild hazing to which Augusta and Flossie
had been subjected earlier in the year had prompted
them to lock the door of their room while at meals
or when both were out in the evening. The persecution
having stopped as suddenly as it had begun,
gradually they grew careless. On this particular
evening they had not locked their door.
</p>
<p>
Gussie, being a foot or two in advance of Flossie,
half opened the door and felt for the button to
throw on the electric light. The nearest hall light
was several doors from her room. Hence the interior
of the room was in comparative darkness. She
uttered an impatient exclamation as her exploring
fingers failed to find the button. She took a quick
step into the room only to discover that something
had suddenly happened to her feet. The soles of her
satin evening slippers had acquired something
which crackled and rustled and clung. She cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
out and lurched clumsily forward in her amazement,
only to trip against something else which threw her
headlong against the center table.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake, Flossie, keep out!” she
loudly warned. “Go for some matches. We’ve
been hazed again. Oh, why didn’t I lock the door?”
</p>
<p>
Her warning came too late. Florence had followed
her, only to find her own feet immeshed in
the same sticky trap.
</p>
<p>
“It’s fly paper, that’s what it is,” she sputtered.
Floundering into the hall, she now called out in
wrathful discovery. “Wait until I free my slippers
of it and I’ll go for some matches.”
</p>
<p>
Out in the hall Flossie ripped her slippers clear
of the sticky paper with a forceful hand. Rolling
it into a loose ball she started with it for the stairs,
her indignation running high. Meanwhile Gussie
had flapped to the open door and was engaged in
ridding her own slippers of the incumbrance.
</p>
<p>
Straight to Miss Remson’s own room sped Flossie,
determined this time to spare no one. She and
Gussie had heretofore silently endured—but no
more of it. A few excited sentences and the manager,
who had also just returned from the concert,
was hurriedly accompanying her upstairs, a lighted
candle and a box of matches in hand.
</p>
<p>
Examination by candle rays of the spot where the
electric push button should be showed that it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
still there, but temporarily eclipsed. It had been
neatly covered over by a smooth piece of cardboard
tacked securely to the wall. In the dark the feel
of the cardboard would be similar to that of the wall
paper. The cardboard ripped off and the light
thrown on, the havoc, already partially revealed by
candle light, showed only too baldly. What Gussie
had fallen over was one of three wooden soap
boxes. These had been placed in a row and covered
with a blue serge coat belonging to her. On the top
of the middle one was a quart can of white paint.
Stumbling, she had tipped it over and it now plentifully
bedecked her coat, the rug, the skirt of her
turquoise blue evening frock and her blue satin slippers.
</p>
<p>
From door to center table, from table to the two
chiffoniers, which stood at each end of the room,
were spread sheets of sticky fly paper. The two
couch beds had been dismantled, and the mattresses,
pillows and bed clothing had disappeared. Every
mirror in the room had been painted in large checks
of red and blue. On one of the dressing tables was
coiled a huge mottled rubber snake which elicited a
general cry of horror on first sight. The door of
both girls’ dress closets stood wide open, revealing
every item of wearing apparel in each, lying in disorderly
heaps on the floor.
</p>
<p>
The crowning outrage was a crude effigy of Gussie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
made from a handkerchief bag and a dark green
velvet one-piece frock of hers on a hanger. The
handkerchief bag, stuffed, served as a head; the
frock on the hanger, the body. Gussie’s blue velvet
sports hat topped the effigy. The whole figure had
been smeared with very thick molasses and feathered.
The feathers had come from one of the
couch pillows, the slashed case of which lay on the
floor. It was a decidedly discouraging sight. The
three shocked, amazed women gazed dumbly at the
damaged room.
</p>
<p>
“A band of savages couldn’t have done much
more,” was Miss Remson’s curt opinion. “You
girls had better move into the room Miss Langly
formerly occupied for the night. Your bedding
will have to be found. It is in the house somewhere,
I presume. It is too late to make inquiries
about it tonight. There will be a searching inquiry
tomorrow in this house or my name is not Miranda
Remson. Such vandalism against another student!
To say nothing of the damage done to the room!
The rug is ruined by that white paint. A workman
alone can remove the paint from the mirrors. Dear
knows where the bedding is. Shocking, and disgusting!”
</p>
<p>
Seized by a sudden thought, Gussie went to one
of the open windows and leaned far out. Presently
she left the window and announced: “I think the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
bedding is on the ground under the windows.
Please let Flossie and I go down and see. If it is
there, we can bring it in at the back door, and up
the back staircase. No one will see us. The mattresses
are light. I can carry them, one at a time.
Flossie can carry the smaller pieces. I’d rather stay
in my own room tonight, if I can.”
</p>
<p>
Flossie, meanwhile, had been engaged in gathering
up the fly paper and putting the room partly to
rights. Miss Remson having given a reluctant consent,
the two freshmen went down stairs on the trail
of the lost bedding. As Gussie had thought, there
it was, under the windows from which it had been
dumped to the ground.
</p>
<p>
The chimes had sung a silvery eleven and the
wall clock ticked off half an hour more before a
semblance of order settled down upon the outraged
room. Miss Remson had long since left the two
victims of the hazing.
</p>
<p>
“You know who did this?” interrogated Gussie,
the moment the manager had retired from the room.
</p>
<p>
“T don’t know, but I think it was Miss Walbert
and some of her pals.” quickly returned Flossie.
“What’s the use of suspecting her when one can’t
prove a single thing against her? She chose a good
night. Who can prove that she wasn’t at the concert?”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t,” returned Gussie gloomily. “I wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
I had just one little proof against her. I believe
some of the team helped her. Alma Hurst dislikes
me most. Perhaps she was mixed up in it. Miss
Remson is going to call a meeting. It won’t do any
good. It will only put the hazers on their guard.
One real bit of proof against Elizabeth Walbert
would do more good than forty meetings.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>CHAPTER XXV—THE PROOF</h2>
<p>
The real bit of proof was nearer her hand then
Augusta had dreamed. Not until the following
evening did she have time to take apart the sticky
effigy of herself. Then she ran her fingers into the
handkerchief bag to ascertain what had been used
for stuffing. She withdrew her hand, clutching
something of harder substance than lace collars and
handkerchiefs. She looked at her find in amazement.
It was a bracelet watch. More, it did not
belong to either herself or Flossie.
</p>
<p>
The heavy gold back of the little watch was monogrammed
with the letters E. A. W. Gussie’s eyes
lighted in triumph. Dexterously she picked open
the back of the watch. She remembered that many
girls had their full names written on a thin inside
case, particularly if the watch were very valuable.
There was more chance of a return in case of loss.
Surely enough, on the inner plate appeared Elizabeth
Walbert’s full name. Gussie had her bit of
proof. In stuffing the handkerchief bag, the watch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
had evidently become unclasped and remained in
the bag. In her hurry to finish and be gone the
marauder had not even missed it.
</p>
<p>
Gussie’s subdued shout of elation startled Flossie,
who was writing a theme. A few minutes’ talk and
the two went down to Miss Remson’s office, there
to remain for some time. The manager had called
a meeting directly after dinner that evening. She
had asked every student present, separately and on
honor, whether they had any part in the outrage of
the evening before. Each had answered in the negative.
She was naturally at sea. It was possible
that the mischief had been done by outside students.
</p>
<p>
Gussie’s information served to bring back Leila’s
warning of early fall against Elizabeth Walbert.
Pledging both freshmen to secrecy, Miss
Remson made a lengthy call on Doctor Matthews
the next morning.
</p>
<p>
The ring leader in the mischief had gone to her
classes that morning feeling complacently secure.
She had said “No” to Miss Remson’s stern inquiry
with an expression of utter innocence in her widely-opened
blue eyes. A telephone call for Elizabeth at
luncheon hour, requesting her to report at Doctor
Matthews’ office at two o’clock that afternoon
caused her no great trepidation. She immediately
jumped to the conclusion that Marjorie had at last
reported her for the accident to the elderly woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
on the highway. She had long since framed her
defense, intending to place the blame squarely upon
her accusers.
</p>
<p>
What she did not expect to see was a familiar
bit of jewelry reposing on the president’s desk.
Possessed of a good deal of jewelry, and very careless
with it, she had not, as yet, missed the watch.
She owned two others, as well, and kept poor track
of them. She had forgotten all about having worn
it while upsetting Gussie’s room.
</p>
<p>
Her memory was soon refreshed in a way that
drove the color from her cheeks and took away her
greatest prop, conceited self-assurance. She tried
to deny her own watch. Her name on the inner
case merely added fuel to the doctor’s wrath. Her
complete downfall came with a burst of hysterical
weeping, of which anger formed a large part.
Pinned down to a confession, she did not hesitate
to name her two allies. They were also sent for,
and before they left the office sentence had been
pronounced upon all three. They were given the
regulation seven days to pack and notify their families.
They were also held for damage to property
and ordered to make monetary restitution.
</p>
<p>
Gussie and Florence utterly refused to accept a
penny from the three for their personal losses. Miss
Remson, however, accepted a settlement for the
damage done to the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
With their departure went the last really pernicious
element in Hamilton College. Elizabeth Walbert
had been, if anything, more unscrupulous than
Leslie Cairns. Lack of a certain sense of balance,
which Leslie had possessed, had prompted her to
enjoy a kind of malicious mischief of which Leslie
would not have entertained a thought.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Well, your last enemy has been routed in confusion,
beautiful Bean. I just saw her depart in a
station taxi. Guess she sent her car home ahead of
her.” Jerry came in from the campus late one afternoon
with this pleasing information.
</p>
<p>
“Glad of it.” Marjorie looked up from a translation
she was making. “She’s to blame for my
trouble with Miss Susanna, indirectly. She deserved
expulsion. I felt sorry for the Sans, a little.
I don’t feel sorry for her. I think she was outrageous;
worse even in disposition than Rowena
Farnham.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry agreed, glad to see Marjorie evince resentment
against the disgraced junior. She realized
that nothing save the utmost bitterness of spirit
could have wrung that denunciation from her charitable
room-mate. Jerry knew how deeply Marjorie
felt the loss of Miss Susanna’s friendship and wished
she could in some way manage to set things to
rights between them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
The more she thought about it the more she felt
impelled to go to Hamilton Arms and “have it out”
with Miss Susanna. It lacked only two days until
May Day, when she definitely decided to go on May
Day evening and plead Marjorie’s cause. The fact
that Miss Susanna had evidently not reported Elizabeth
Walbert was to Jerry an indication of her
leniency toward Marjorie. Jerry shrewdly suspected
that the old lady would welcome a peace
ambassador.
</p>
<p>
On May Day evening, at a little after seven
o’clock, she lifted the heavy knocker of the Arms
and waited rather sheepishly for an answer to her
ring. She had not the least idea of what she should
say to Miss Susanna, provided the latter would see
her.
</p>
<p>
Jonas greeted her with delighted surprise in his
fine old face. “I’m so glad you came, Miss Jerry,”
he said. “She’ll be glad, too. She misses the little
girl, God bless her.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry felt a slight catch in her throat at the
words. They were precisely like two pathetic old
children, she thought, who had lost a merry playmate.
Jonas’ prediction that Miss Hamilton would
be glad to see her was verified. She shook hands
with Jerry, then she kissed her. Next she took out
her handkerchief and wiped away a few tears which
had welled to her eyes. Then the two sat down for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
a long talk. Jerry did most of the talking. Miss
Susanna listened like a thirsty plant greedily absorbing
water.
</p>
<p>
“It was all my fault,” the old lady declared contritely.
“I was upset by the fall, and crotchety. I
wouldn’t give my poor child a hearing. Worse, I
didn’t answer her letter. I was still provoked with
her when I received it. Later, I came to my senses.
But I haven’t forgotten her. I have done something
for her that she’ll like. Just think! Two
years ago she came here all by herself and hung that
violet May basket! I have been happier since then.
Now we must get back to our good times again. If
any of you simpletons of girls had come to see me
before we could have straightened this snarl long
ago.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry laughed at this last. “It’s true, Miss Susanna,”
she agreed, “we were simpletons. Leila spoke
of coming over here once to me. I told her I would
go, except I thought Marjorie would not like us to
do so.”
</p>
<p>
“I should have answered her letter. I wasn’t fair
to her. I am going to write her a little note this
evening. Jerry, will you be my messenger? This
is Uncle Brooke’s birthday, you know. Marjorie
will like to hear from me tonight on that very
account. You go into the Chinese room and talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
to Jonas, while I’m writing it. That is his favorite
haunt. He always reads his paper in there.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry was quite willing to interview Jonas in the
Chinese room. She loved the room and she thought
Jonas the most interesting old man she had ever
seen. She wished she could induce him to speak of
Brooke Hamilton. She liked the idea of having
some interesting bit of information concerning the
latter to take back to Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
Being an exceedingly clever young person, she
skillfully drew Jonas out to talk of the founder of
Hamilton. He told her several incidents of his
former employer’s life that were of vivid interest.
The most amazing bit of information she gleaned
from Jonas, however, was the fact that the old man
had attended the performance of both plays and the
concert as well.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Susanna was anxious I should attend
them,” he explained, his face breaking into a crinkle
of little smiling lines that Jerry thought beautiful.
“But I should have gone to them, at any rate. Tell
our Sunshine girl so for me. Tell her, too, that if
she had lived in Mr. Brooke’s time she would have
been his staunchest supporter and ally. Her interest
in the college he loved comes second to his own.”
</p>
<p>
The old servitor’s deep voice echoed through the
spacious room. For an instant Jerry was seized by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
the eerie fancy that the departed Brooke Hamilton
himself had been speaking.
</p>
<p>
When Jerry left Hamilton Arms it was nearly
nine o’clock. Jonas insisted on accompanying her
to the campus gates. Darkness had fallen and there
was no moonshine until after midnight. Jerry carried
with her the note and an immense round bunch
of double, sweet-scented garden violets; these last,
Miss Susanna’s peace-offering to Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Um-m! How sweet!” Marjorie caught
the fragrance of the violets the moment Jerry entered
the room. She cried out with pleasure as she
saw the perfumed purple blossoms. “Where have
you been? Who gave you those perfectly lovely
violets, Jeremiah?”
</p>
<p>
“Guess where I’ve been.” Jerry advanced to the
table where Marjorie sat with her books. She
dropped the note and the flowers directly in front of
her chum.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Jeremiah!” Marjorie cried out. First
glance at the note and she had recognized that familiar
fine hand. Such violets as those she now held
to her flushed face grew only at Hamilton Arms.
“I—I—don’t see——” she began. Then her curly
head went down on the table, supported by one
rounded arm.
</p>
<p>
When she raised it again two or three tears
trembled on her long lashes, but a smile irradiated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
her face. “I wondered where you had gone, Jerry,”
she said tremulously. “Now I know. And you did
it for me! I don’t have to read Miss Susanna’s
note to know that everything is all right again. I
only have to look at these violets. Mr. Brooke
Hamilton’s favorite flower and today was his birthday!
It’s just two years tonight since I hung the
May basket on Miss Susanna’s door. She said after
we came to know her that the violets that night
seemed like a message from him. Somehow I feel
that way about these violets. He planted them and
tended them. They are like a fragrant message of
good will from him.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>CHAPTER XXVI—THE CITATION</h2>
<p>
Before Marjorie saw Miss Susanna, who had
invited her in the note to come to Hamilton Arms
to dinner on Friday, another surprise was in store
for her. She had paid no special attention to a
notice which appeared on the main bulletin board
the day after she had received the violets from Miss
Susanna. It stated that a full attendance of students
was requested on Friday morning in the
chapel.
</p>
<p>
“What’s going to happen at chapel, I wonder,
that we are all ordered to be there?” commented
Muriel Harding that evening, at the usual nightly
confab.
</p>
<p>
“Special notices to be read, very likely,” surmised
Ronny. “From now on, we’ll begin to hear them.
It’s not very long until Commencement, children.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t speak of it.” Jerry held up a protesting
hand. “I think I ought to have at least four more
years of education. I’m not half educated. I don’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
want to leave Hamilton this June, knowing I’m not
coming back to it.”
</p>
<p>
This in a measure was the attitude the others
were gradually taking. With the growth of the
new dormitory project came the earnest longing “to
stay just one more year” and see its furtherance.
On the other hand there were the home folks to
be considered. Marjorie in particular felt that her
captain would not care to spare her away from
home another year. Nor would she ask that permission.
</p>
<p>
When on Friday morning row upon row of more
or less lovely girl faces, each with its own particular
charm of youth, lined the large auditorium of the
chapel, no pair of bright eyes missed the significance
of Doctor Matthews’ presence and that of the entire
Board. Something out of the ordinary was about
to take place.
</p>
<p>
Morning exercises over, Doctor Matthews proceeded
to address the scrupulously attentive assemblage.
</p>
<p>
“It may not be known to many students present,”
he said, “that the college has very little data concerning
its noble founder, Brooke Hamilton. We
know that he planned this monument to learning on
a broad and magnificent scale. We know that he
superintended the erection of the buildings. We
know that he spent his life near it, at Hamilton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
Arms; that the town of Hamilton, Hamilton Highway,
West Hamilton—all these bear his honored
name.”
</p>
<p>
At the words, “Brooke Hamilton,” the sharper
interest of the original Nine Travelers became
focussed upon the president. Something of exceptional
interest to them was certain to follow the
mention of that name. Nor was the pith of the
doctor’s discourse long in coming. Their interest
deepened to astonishment as they heard him presently
take up the subject of the maxims of Hamilton’s
founder. Not only did he quote the five already
framed and hung in the college buildings. He
also quoted the other ten on the illuminated oblong
in the founder’s study at Hamilton Arms.
</p>
<p>
Jerry was the first to catch the drift of the address.
She recalled Miss Susanna’s words in speaking
of Marjorie: “I have done something for her
that she’ll like.” She thought she now understood.
Marjorie was to receive a citation. Miss Susanna
had planned the honor undoubtedly.
</p>
<p>
Jerry had not gone so far as even to dream that
there might be others also entitled to this high
honor. The announcement of Marjorie’s name
presently confirmed her conjecture. When Leila’s,
Helen’s, her own name, and, in fact, those of the
others who made up Miss Susanna’s nine young
friends followed Marjorie’s, Jerry began to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
stars. The tenth name, Robin Page, sent an electric
shock through them all. Robin had not known
Miss Susanna, but the latter had certainly known
her through Marjorie’s generous praise.
</p>
<p>
Asked to rise in their places, the ten seniors, thus
to be honored, listened to a citation of their good
deeds which made their cheeks burn and their hearts
beat faster. Miss Susanna Hamilton, it appeared,
had been very busy in their behalf.
</p>
<p>
President Matthews addressed each girl in turn
by name, reciting the maxim to be hung in her
honor and stating the place on the campus the
framed tribute would occupy. Miss Susanna had
shown her marked affection for Marjorie in the
choice of motto she had made. Marjorie’s maxim
was, “The ways of light reach upward toward eternity.”
</p>
<p>
While no demonstrations of approbation were
permitted in chapel, the air was full of repressed
acclamation which would be presently set free outside.
The turn of the tide for democracy had
occurred almost four years before when the ten
seniors thus elevated to distinction and a few other
loyal spirits had set their faces firmly against snobbery
and false principles. Now they were to experience
the full sweep of the waves of approbation on
which their classmates proposed to launch them.
</p>
<p>
It was a never-to-be-forgotten morning. Everyone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
was late to first recitations, and no one cared.
Aside from the citations themselves, another glorious
fact stood forth clearly. In some marvelous
manner those who had received the honor of citation
had been instrumental in ending the estrangement
of long standing between the college and the
great-niece of its reverend founder.
</p>
<p>
Coming in late that afternoon, Marjorie found a
summons to Doctor Matthews’ office awaiting her.
The time set was three o’clock of the following
afternoon. She smiled as she read the few lines
penned by the doctor. She was fairly positive that
he wished to question her regarding her friendship
with Miss Susanna. Lucy had said at luncheon
that the doctor was anxious to talk with her.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of her own happiness, Marjorie
thought rather sadly of how different had been the
purpose of the summons received by the Sans and
Elizabeth Walbert. She wondered if the parents of
many of these girls had not been cut to the heart
over their utter failure. A silent song of rejoicing
welled within her soul that she had nothing but
good reports to present to her superior officers. She
was glad her ways had been ways of light.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>CHAPTER XXVII—CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
“I can’t believe it’s true. Pinch my arm, Robin;
not very hard, just enough to make me know I’m
awake.” It was Marjorie who made this request.
</p>
<p>
It was late in the afternoon of Commencement
Day and the original Nine Travelers, Robin and
Phyllis Moore, were holding a brief farewell rendezvous
in Marjorie’s and Jerry’s room. Their
elders and relatives who had come to Hamilton to
see their own graduated were scattered about the
campus. The eleven girls had claimed the privilege
of one last little private session as an expression of
their overflowing feelings. Jerry, the zealous, had
managed to “round them up” and order them to
report at four o’clock in hers and Marjorie’s room.
</p>
<p>
“It’s true.” Robin accompanied the assurance
with a gentle pinch. “Out of the darkness has
come light. I wish we could do something for
Miss Susanna to prove our gratitude.”
</p>
<p>
“I said that to her this morning,” Marjorie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
returned. “She said ‘there is only one thing any of
you could do for me,—come back to Hamilton next
year. Now I know you are not free to do that. It
rests with your parents. I suppose you will not be
coming back to college. Well, you can at least
make me a visit; singly, doubly, severally, or all at
once.’”
</p>
<p>
“Would you like to come back, Marjorie?” asked
Phyllis. “I ask because I know how your heart has
been set on furthering the dormitory project.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I should,” Marjorie answered honestly.
“Now that this wonderful thing has happened, I
can’t bear not to be here next year. I know that
you and Barbara and the new Travelers we’ve
chosen will look after things as well, if not better,
than we have, but it seems hard to be so far away
when the real work is going to begin. I understand
why Mr. Brooke Hamilton wished to be near
the campus when the college buildings were being
erected.”
</p>
<p>
The “wonderful thing” to which Marjorie referred
was in the nature of an announcement made
at the Commencement exercises that morning. Miss
Susanna Hamilton had, through the offices of President
Matthews, presented to her young friend, Marjorie
Dean, a clear title to the lower block of houses
west of the campus, formerly owned by her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Miss Dean has devoted her earnest effort to
securing a site on which to erect a dormitory to be
devoted to the housing of students in reduced circumstances.
Such students are entitled to their
time for study rather than the performance of extra
work in order to pay their expenses. It is my wish
that Miss Dean shall use the properties with which
I now present her as a site for the dormitory of her
dreams.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Signed,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“<span class='sc'>Susanna Craig Hamilton.</span>”</p>
<p>
This last paragraph of a letter, written to Doctor
Matthews by Miss Hamilton, and read out at the
exercises, produced a sensation in collegiate circles.
Doctor Matthews had called on Miss Hamilton,
shortly before Commencement Day, asking her to
attend the exercises as his honored guest. The
eccentric old lady had refused flatly.
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t forgiven the college, altogether.
You must let me alone. I am what I am, and I
don’t often change. I owed my little friend, Marjorie
Dean, a reparation. I have made it in the way
I thought she would like best. Personally, you are
the most sensible and true gentleman I have known
on a college staff since my great-uncle passed out.
If they had all been like you—but they haven’t
been.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
The good doctor had smiled openly at Miss Susanna’s
avowed hard-heartedness. He had an idea
that time would do its perfect work in closing the
breach between herself and Hamilton, now that
Marjorie had pointed the way.
</p>
<p>
“While we are on the subject,” declared Leila,
“I wonder how many of us here could come back
if we wished. Don’t all speak at once. As for Irish
Leila,—her time is as good here as anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“I can come back,” Vera immediately said. “I
have really nothing in the way of social aspirations.
Father would let me come back for one year; maybe
more. If I come back for five or six years, I’d be
a colossus of learning if not one in stature.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure that I can, but I’ll coax hard at
home,” assured Helen. “Miss Remson said last
night that she would hold our rooms until the middle
of July for any of us who knew by that time we
were coming back.”
</p>
<p>
“Kathie’s already here. If mother will let me,
I’ll add another year of biology and work for the
doctor to my collegiate budget.” Lucy made this
announcement with a touch of excitement.
</p>
<p>
“I can come back if I feel like it.” Jerry cast an
almost gloomy look at Marjorie as she spoke. She
was not relishing the prospect without Marjorie as
a room-mate.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure. It will depend on what my father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
says. I have been away from him the greater part
of four years.” This from Ronny. “Last summer
he talked of spending a winter in the East. If he
decides to do that he will be in New York. In that
event I could probably come back to Hamilton,
but,”—Ronny also looked straight at Marjorie.
</p>
<p>
“I can do as I please about coming back. I
thought I might, if——” Robin’s eyes found the
same resting place as those of the others. “We
want you to come back, too, Marjorie. We can’t
get along without you,” she said with friendly
abruptness.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know.” A hint of distress crept into
Marjorie’s brown eyes. “I have never mentioned
such a thing to Captain. I’d feel selfish in doing so.
She has waited patiently for me to finish college so
that I may be at home with her. She has never said
she wanted me to stay at home after I was graduated.
I suppose she never thought I would care to
come back as a P. G. If you girls are free to come
back, I wish you would. You could be of so much
help to the others. I’ll be able to get here two or
three times during the college year, at least. Robin
and I will have to come here sometime this summer
to see how the work of tearing down those properties
is progressing. I’ll say this. If the way should
happen to clear for me to come back a P. G., that
means if Captain should be willing and really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
anxious for me to return to Hamilton, because she
knows how greatly my heart is in our enterprise,
then I’ll certainly be here next fall. That is as
much of a promise as I can make.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel in my prophetic Celtic bones that you will
come back,” predicted Leila. “Your Captain is too
wise not to know your secret ambitions. She will
be presently driving you back to college. You may
expect me in my same old room next year, and——”
Leila smiled her wide, engaging smile, “I shall expect
to see you, Beauty, ornamenting the campus as
of old. You may tell me then that I am a soothsayer.”

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
